            "If you're wanting a Christian, conservative college, do not go to Hardin Simmons. It is a surprisingly liberal and close minded school. They teach unbiblical topics in chapel which you're required to attend. I went to this school thinking it was centered around Christ. But it is opposite. Even the students didn't act like you would think they would": {

Incredible views if you\u2019re someone that enjoys the outdoors. 5 minute radius from campus you have access to the beaches, forests, rivers, a lake and more! The community is very welcoming, Arcata is a very cute small town vibes. The campus itself is very clean and well kept too.": {
