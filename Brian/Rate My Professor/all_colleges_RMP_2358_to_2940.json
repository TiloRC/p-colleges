            "LACC is a great community college. Almost all of the professors I had were top notch. If you think you wont get a quality education here, you are wrong. Class sizes are typically small in case you are concerned. I never had a class with more than 45 students at LACC. Lastly, I was able to transfer to Oxy and got into UCLA. LACC gets the job done!": {

            " I think Pierce is a good school in general. The professors seem to care, people are friendly. The academics at Pierce are more challenging than at other schools, but they teach you what you need to know. The classes are super  cheap, the textbooks are the most expensive part of going here. Overall I am happy here and recommend it to others.  ": {

The EOP&amp;S program is amazing and helps pay for books and school supplies. Even if it seems hard to make a counselor appointment go in person not online. Saves money more than 4-year colleges.": {

Some of the professors do not know how to control a classroom whatsoever, but to be fair this is college and they shouldn't have to control a classroom. Overrated in my opinion.": {

The food is good and there is a lot of space available to do your work at, indoors and outdoors. The computer labs and library are both great and the professors have all been awesome.": {

Some staff know how to do their job, but most don't. It's fine to get your GE stuff. but other than that I don't like this place. Feels like a big high school filled with depressed adults. ": {

The area has it perks with fishing and the spillway, but other than that its a boring town. Nothing to do but study, party, and get into trouble. Also the food is not good, the cooking staff is the sweetest though :)": {

What a joke, No Dorms, No Dining Hall, Tiny Library that has like 20 books max. All one big room so its hard to concentrate on the class your in. People just wonder around and they dont say anything about it. What a Jokw!": {

Not all teachers are good and some of them suck as they pass discouraging comments. \nThe food in the cafeteria is pricey. There are only some dedicated students and majority of them transfer. Be ready to spend money here\n": {

Clubs are the usual. if you have an AM get there early to find parking. The only annoying thing is the people at campus asking for signatures. But overall great.": {

Most of the professors here are very good, and actually want you to succeed. \n\nThe advising department I think is the worst issue I\u2019ve had at SPC. I finally switched to planning, finding and registering for my classes all on my own. ": {
