            "Really amazing school flooded with opportunity. The price tag tends to deter some more down-to-earth people, but overall it is exceedingly easy to meet wonderful people that are super supportive and caring. There are tons of clubs and activities on campus. Most professors are absolutely top notch and truly care about your learning. LOVE it here!!!!": {
