This means that you will be harassed by ppl when you are moving around campus. I've also heard that its not a good idea to take night classes there have been many robberies when ppl r walking back 2 their cars. Also parking sucks": {

On the Brightside, MCC allowed me to go to school for two years for free and got me into the University of Michigan! This is a very smart option! ": {

You don't really go here to make friends or gain fun experiences. The building is super hard to navigate. Other than that it is a pretty decent school.": {

The building design is confusing but still a nice building. So far Ive liked most of my professors. I didnt hate any of them, because they were all caring and want their students to succeed!": {
