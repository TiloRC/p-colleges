If you are transferring from a junior/community college, and want a no-judgment and chill environment, come here. BTW THE COLLEGE CAMPUS POLICE ARE HORRIBLE. Yes, I was literally stalked by a man who did not come on campus, and they just laughed at me on the phone. ": {

It is a great place to live (minus the drive through the canyon) and it has a lot of fun stuff to do if you get to know the right people. PLUS, it is extremely cheap. Also, the campus is small and personal. It is an amazing school to start out at. I have really enjoyed it here.": {
