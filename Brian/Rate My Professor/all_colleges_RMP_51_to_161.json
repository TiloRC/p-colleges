I graduated and quickly got a fulltime + freelance in the animation industry. This is not the place for following a hobby. There is also no social encouragement and youre often pitted against eachother. :( No friends but good pay now, lol.": {

Get ready for 5 relgious classes that are mandatory to take that dont teach you anything and have nothing to do with your major.

            "Listen, Baldwin Wallace is the definition school of \"it is what you make it.\" YOU make the experience. There are great opportunities, the classes are small, people are really friendly, and you will learn. A degree from BW is respected, especially around the Cleveland area. Things could be better but it could be a lot worse. Im happy here :)": {

There is literally no instruction in the online classes- you pretty much pay $3,000 to cram an entire textbook by yourself in one quarter. Also, their insurance doesn't cover vaccines and titers... which are mandatory. Run": {

            "Calarts' reputation only comes from its animation alumni. The rose tinted glasses quickly come off during your first semester when you see that this place is literally FALLING APART. With as much as tuition costs it makes you wonder where it's all going. Don't expect any answers or help from administration. If you're not a trust fund baby don't go.": {

Too many students come in with barely a 2.5 GPA from high school and expect to slide with easy As and Bs and to be coddled by professors. The problem is, some of us work hard and expect responsible classmates and we instead get adolescents. This college definitely needs to raise its standards.": {
