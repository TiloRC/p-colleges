            "Niagara University is a beautiful campus 10 minutes away from anything fun around it. COVID has been tough HOWEVER, they do all they can to restore normalcy. A strong student community based campus with so many opportunities for networking and involvement. Dorms are big, social spaces accessible, and food is really good! Free laundry and printing!!": {

Small campus, no parking spots yet you have to pay for parking. People (students &amp; professors) are VERY judgmental and small diversity. Good luck.": {
