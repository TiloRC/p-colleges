How to use RMP class.
Currently, the class is configured such that the scraper will attempt to scrape ALL of the schools that are in RMP's database.
Schools are categorized by ID NUMBERS, starting from 1 to about 6500. 

If you want to scrape a specific school, find its ID NUMBER using the RMP website, and then run this command:
    SCHOOL = UnigoScraper(''.join(row), scrapeOneSchool=True)
    SCHOOL.makeJson()

The output is a json file with the name SCHOOL.json. Here is an example json file (truncated)

{
    "University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)": {
        "School_Overall": 4.2,
        "School_Reputation": 4.6,
        "School_Location": 4.5,
        "School_Facilities": 4.4,
