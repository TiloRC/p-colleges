The food honestly isn't terrible, but I have gotten food poisoning a few times from the chicken here. The workout facilities are terrible and need to be updated, and the parking is a nightmare. ": {

If you don't join any organizations and sit in your dorm all day, you simply will hate it here because there isn't really much to do on campus alone outside of clubs. The best part of Samford is the professors, they really do care about us and want us to succeed in/out of the classroom.": {

But there is always something happening on campus!": {
