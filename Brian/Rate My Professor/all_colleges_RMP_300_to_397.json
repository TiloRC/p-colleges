            "Georgia Tech is a highly prestigious school. This is mostly a good thing! Most of my professors have been awesome and GT has provided me with countless career opportunities. On the other hand, the five years it took me to graduate was TOUGH. I did not have as much free time as my friends who went to U(sic)GA. Overall, I'm glad I went here!": {

The campus is nice, but I live in one of the oldest, if not THE oldest dorms on campus... so... there's that. Classes so far have been good, and there not as bad as people make them out to be (sometimes).": {
