Cafeteria food sucks, no diversity at all, professors care but faculty doesn't, chapel is 3-4 times a week and exemptions are near impossible to get even if you have proof of a physical injury, not a party town/school, stuck up Caucasian people, run down dorms, high school cliques. Good luck. ": {

            "Alvernia is an amazing school and has a lot of opportunities for the more quiet people. If you are a party person and want a school where there are nonstop ragers then this is the wrong school for you. If you are going to school for a good education and to have some low key fun this school is perfect. I absolutely love it here.": {
