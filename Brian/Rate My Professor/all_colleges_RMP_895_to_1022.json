Most (but not all) teachers are chill and great, and you get used to the mediocre food.  Overall, I am pleased with Shepherd given it's cheaper price for a university.": {

Classes are pretty small and most departments have the same professors teaching each class. Small town university. I am so grateful for SMSU and can\u2019t wait to graduate. ": {

The PA program is mentally and emotionally draining to put it lightly. Stay away.  ": {

The people are wonderful, I love the majority of the professors that I've had so far, and the campus is small and quiet. Plus, Columbia is a great city to be in :)": {

The food is just very much ok and the wifi here is just ok. Seguin Texas is not a college city, and I think that is why people don't seem to like Texas Lutheran University as much. Overall not bad, but also not great. ": {
