Parties are always going on year-round , so if you want to fail, go ahead and attend the majority of those. \nTraditional housing - eh, you get what you pay for. Up-scale housing will cost you an arm and a leg, but it's worth it (larger living space, with attached bathroom)\nCafe food is a 50/50 on most days \n\n"

The academics that stand within Alabama A&M is very intellectual it gives your mind a free space to think and voice your opinion when needed. The campus is very cozy, its basically another place to call home. You will undergo many different experiences with other students as well as professors. The professors here at Alabama A&M make it a purpose to help your work as well help you search for opportunities outside of school. The environment here is very peaceful and different , you learn  and you find yourself more involved in different activities on various levels. "

The school has a lot of issues with discipline and whats really important. It seems like the administrations brains is like \"Students already enrolled? or prospective students? Eh prospective students are more important because we need there money so even if they transfer somewhere else, they cant. All because they wont be able to get there transcript without paying off their university bill. Oh, but hey who cares right. We're not the students, we are just the ones who feed the parents a load of crap at Orientation so we can get some more of their money.\" This school has too many issues and needs either some more funding or a whole new staff and hiring process.

My college doesn't proved breakfast lunch and dinner with good hours for all inbetween. Great transportation and provides an app , so you would know when and where the bus would be there .

Nestled in a somewhat urban area of Huntsville, Alabama, this university was as outdated as the founding father buried there. For students raised by it's alum, this university is purely magical as the walk and live vicariously through the glasses of the predecessors before them. However, for someone new to this, it was absolutely lackluster in comparison to the historically black university I had to leave due to illnesses. Now the meat of this review, the Biology department was mostly ran by voices that showed up for their tenure but lost the most important parts of themselves, their passion. They would show up to the first day of class with their twisted lips and a syllabus that oozed various stereotypes of the majority, yet their attendance records were scarce despite the expectations they had for their students. Our building may have still had remnants of mold and carcinogens, their telescopes were older than my parents, and their resources were not competing with the universities around them.  I'm sure most will not heed to this review, however if you're looking for exposure to opportunities like studying abroad it's very scarce. "

I would ask more questions about the costs associated with each individual college and the curriculum needed to become an Occupational Therapist.\n\nWhile participating in sports and volunteer services, I would make a stronger effort to obtain references from teachers, my principal and volunteer coordinators.  Something I learned the hard way is that it is very important to follow-up on contacts you\u2019ve made.  I would not assume that because someone is an adult, they would follow through on references without a friendly reminder from me.\n\nI was a procrastinator in high school, always putting things off until the last minute.

College can get very tiring and stressful at times especially if you don't have balance, time management skills, and good studying habits. If you don't surround yourself with positive people there is a chance that you can be thrown off of the right path because of the partying, excessive work and lack of motivation.

One lesson I would tell my 18 year old self in high school is to let him know that at this moment in his life that he is not ready for college.  It is hard to admit to yourself that you are not mature enough to handle the stressors of college; some people can handle it, others cannot.  Joining the Air Force and serving my country for six years has been the most rewarding time of my life and helped me to grow as a person.  It gave me the discipline I needed to help cope with the importance of college and to help deal with all the weight on my shoulders.

Subsequently, this will afford me the opportunity to experience the level of reading, writing and creative thinking that is required to be successful.  Additionally, I would warn myself about the seriousness of procrastination.  It will cause undue stress and will not allow me the opportunity to showcase the quality of work that I am capable of achieving.  Finally, the last word of advice I would give, would be in reference to time management and how it is  the key to success  in whatever it is that you do in life.

Second, I would join clubs, sports and organizations to gain more experience and extracurricular activities. Third, I would prepare and study the SAT in order to ace the test, to be qualified for my desired university, and to attract more scholarships to help me financially. Fourth, I would research and apply for scholarship opportunities online. Fifth, I would apply for jobs in the summer to have my own pocket money, to subsidize my colllege fees.

I loved going to culinary school, but I think that I could have gone straight to athletic training if I knew back then that's what I wanted to do, and I still would have been happy.

In pondering our past decisions and turning over hypotheticals in our heads, it\u2019s impossible not to also wonder what outcome our current decisions will have.\nIf I had it to do all over again, or if I could at least give advise to my high school self, it would be to work harder.

It\u2019s difficult at that young age of 18/19 not to get lost exploring your new freedoms and independence.

Each of these items is important to the overal choice of which college to attend.  Colleges and the programs they offer are significant to choosing the appropriate major and jobs linked to that major.  The college atmosphere is central fitting other students and establishing  a functional network.\n\nMentorship can last a lifetime.  It should have started as soon as possible upon entering college.  Networking and mentorship are closely related.  Mentorship  would have allowed me to begin the process of learning from and networking with a person who was established in his/her career.  Theoretically this person could have guided me throughout my career.  Fitting in with other students would have allowed me to establish a learning network.  Learning this before college would have allowed me to establish a viable network of mentor and friends that would have been beneficial throughout college.",

I would have told my self to apply to way more colleges and for way more scholarships.  I would have kept all my notes and binders from each subject; because your first year is like highschool all over again. Having better time management skills would help tramendously. Focusing more on my education than on a social life would have made things easier. Interacting with people with a different ethnic background; would be a easier transition in college. In college theres so much diversity and if your so use to just seeing one type of group its kinda hard adjusting. Studying alone and reading more in highschool would definately make me a better writer. The transition is so different in college all you have is yourself so getting a job and being independent would really ease alot of finacial problems once you actually get to college.",

First lesson I learned was that it is unfair to judge a school based on a few bad reccomendations, like with A&M, the opinions of others may not be truly reflecting the school's capabilities but instead those of the student/person giving the opinion.  My experience at this school has also shown me the benefits in being open minded and exploring new cultures and activities.  While at A&M I participated in many educational and extracurricular activities which exposed me to new ways of learning, having fun, and allowed me to interact (and form friendships) with people I may not have been as willing to meet without the influence of A&M.  The administration has taught me to be more responsible and \"take-charge\" through showing me that I should never depend on others to handle my affairs. Though I encountered many peaks and valleys with starting and finishing my college career at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University,  I truly can say that I have enjoyed the experience and the memories it created.",

While juggling my duties as a full-time student and mother I have grown tremendously.  My college experience has taught me  how to interact with people from all walks of life.  I have also shed my shy former self and now communicate better with others. The most valuable change since beginning my college journey has been my  developed  thirst for knowledge which goes beyond the classroom.  I now truly understand that education is a priviledge,  and the hard work and time dedicated to it is well worth the struggle.  My professors, classmates, advisors, and family have all been key in my transformation from someone unsure of my potential into a confident and serious scholar.  I am currently being refined as a college student.  I will emerge from my college experience as an amazing new version of me, just as the phoenix was reborn from ashes.",

Teachers reminded and treated students for almost everthing:  behave in class, bring your homework everyday,  get to class early or you will stand at corner of the room, and many other things.  College was different in a better way. The first day of class my teacher gave me a calender with all the assignments and test dates. My teacher said that eveything we would do was there and that there is no excuse for not knowing when something is due: That was something that I had never experience before; I thought it was cool.  College was pure responsibility. No more help and reminders from parents and teachers.  Everthing was up to me now: from choosing my schedule, looking for help,  and turning my assignments.

Making one's self get up, and get ready for class in a timely and efficient manner is a very important key to succeeding in college. If you are not on time to class, there is no office to go to and get a tardy pass, which i visited frequently. The professor may, or may not allow a late student to enter the classroom. I would also advise myself not allow myself to only socialize with those whom I've already known. I would force myself to speak and interact with individuals I would not typically interact with. In college, there might be a lot of diversity, or a little.  Personally, A&M does not have much diversity, but those students whom are the minority, I almost never interact wtih. There is so much that can be learned from individuals of different walks of life, and it is a shame to rob one's self of such an oppertunity. Lastly, I would advise saving any and all extra money .

                "Silvanus ": "The transition to college life has been quite an unexpected experience. If I was a high school senior, the main advice I would give myself is to be open-minded in meeting new people. People come from a wide variety of backgrounds and upbringings, and their rituals or sense of normalcy may include things that myself may not be accustomed to.  Another piece of advice that I would give myself is to make sure that I have goals and no matter what disstractions may appear, it is chiefly important to constantly remind myself of my purpose of being in school. With parties and many other extra-curricular activities it is easy to become more involved with other thing and forget my academic responsibility.  The last piece of advice I would give myself is to avoid pocrastination. Being away in college and not having someone constantly telling me to do something it is easy to wait until the last minute to complete things. With that in mind, it is important to set a schedule and do things in a timely manner to avoid stress. With this advice the trasition to college would have been much smoother.",
                "Kiara ": "While you are still enrolled in high school, do your best throughout the entire semester. I?m sure most of your classes are electives and you feel as if they are not important, but they still count towards your grade point average. Colleges you apply to will look at your grade point average and it can also help you qualify for different scholarships. You need to apply to as many scholarships as possible to help you pay for school. I recommend that you spend a great deal of time looking into different colleges. You may have a particular college in mind, but you may find a school you like even more. You should also visit these different schools. Take a tour around campus and meet different students that are already enrolled or have graduated from that college. These students can give you better insight on the school. I know that a lot of kids? parents tend to put pressure on their child about going to a certain university, but the choice is up to you. You want to be somewhere that you feel comfortable. I hope this advice is very helpful in your transition from high school to college.",
                "Claudia ": "If I were allowed the chance to go back and give myself advice, I would say put the college you truly wanna go to and do not just follow someone else.  Also try to be financially responsible. Don't just go shopping because your parents put money in your account or  because you want the lastest fashion, spend your money wisely such as buying the things you need first, like books or food for your room. The most important is keeping track of deadlines, such as for papers or even applications that may need to be turned in.  Don't be afraid to have meet with your professors outside of class because you can get a better understanding. Don't let peer pressure get to you, just be yourself and you will be just fine.",

I would make sure I know that nothing comes easy and to work hard for what I want. When applying for college to look deeper into things. I wouldn't just pick any school, I will make sure it's the best for me. Focus is the most important thing!  Another advice I will give myself is to not move far away from home. That is the biggest mistake I could have made by choosing a college.  the advice I would give myself is to stay strong and don't party too much in college. Just have fun and make good grades.",

When in high school, applying for colleges was a hardship, but when I finally found the college that was suitiable for me, I was excited.  If I could do it again and talk to myself I would say that college is what a person makes of it.  By doing this, go to the college/university that best fits you, and not what sounds fun or a good time.  If the college/universtiy does not have  everything that you enjoy doing, diversity, hobbies, majors, or space then you may want to reconsider and pick another college/university that does.  High school teachers always put infaces on college, saying it is not like high school; but yet I find it exactly the same, but with more people, bigger classes, leasure, and most of all freedom.  Being an undecided major would have been alright, because then I could have found what really interest me.  The same work habit that I had in high school, maintain that, but just keep working that much harder.   Set goals and plans.   College is valuable,  you determine the outcome.",

I would also tell myself watch who you hang around with because depending on who you hang with might be putting out a bad image on you and you never know who is watching.  Also get involved from the beinging of your freshmen year, it can help you in the long run and make the transition to college alot easier. Those are just a couple of things i would tell myself if i was able to go back in time.",

They hang out with their friends, they go to parties, they join clubs and teams, and they're eager to dive into 'grown-up' activities like driving, having a job, and going to bars. .I remember when I was about to go to university I read a few times something along the lines of, \"College is great. It's a fresh start and you can totally re-invent yourself!\" That's true to a point but I think overall the kind of person you were in high-school is going to be the kind of person you are when you first get to university.",

They offer plenty of activities and events for students to attend, as well as great resources available for anything from health problems to needing free food for your room. But, all of these services and activities have caused the price of attendance to be really high. You'll have a great time while quickly going broke."

Also, there isn't much to do on campus on the weekends, as many students are commuters and don't stay on campus on the weekends, and many students who do live on campus are from nearby and go home on the weekends instead of staying on campus. Overall, academics are fine -- if you're a pre-med student, academics are excellent (and difficult) since UAB has a great medical school. While the campus isn't a \"traditional,\" the undergraduate campus is still distinct from the other schools and the rest of downtown, so that's good."

We know we won't always agree, but we recognize that appreciating each others' differences is important and broadens our understanding of the world.

The HUC has three different options in the cafeteria, The Grill, Chik-fil-A, and Taco Bell. The Grill is my personal favorite, It has different main courses every day ranging from beef tips and rice to turkey and dressing with all kinds of stuff between. Then they offer around four different vegetables every day. So if you are trying to eat a bit healthier, I would eat at the Grill. Also at the Grill, things like hamburgers, veggie burgers, and philly's can be ordered on the spot. Chik-fil-A usually has a long line, but it usually goes pretty fast. Taco Bell always has line and it always takes forever. But everything is made to order, so you are basically waiting on freshness, which is good. There are also items in the cold case like salads, fruit, and sandwiches. There are always fresh bananas and apples available as well if you are just wanting a quick snack. \r\n\r\nAt the Commons, they have a better variety of foods. They have everything from a salad bar to pizza. The salad bar is great because it has several different toppings, dressings, and so on. The Commons also has a place to order burgers on the spot. \r\n\r\nAs to which place is better really depends on who you ask. I prefer the HUC for many reasons, like it is closer, I like to at the Grill, and the Commons is too loud for me. However, the HUC has less options. But either way, the food is always good.\r\n\r\nOn campus beside Snoozy's (a book store) is a Subway. This Subway always seems to be packed out, but the sandwiches are never bad. There is one down side to Subway, it doesn't take Dinning Dollars or Meal Plan. Subway only accepts Blazer Bucks. (Dinning Dollars are added to your account if you are taking at least 12 credit hours and you can use them at the HUC, the Commons, and StarBucks. The meal plan is actually a plan that you purchase. And Blazer Bucks is money that you can load onto your ID Card.)\r\n\r\nAl's is right off capmus down 10th street. Al's is open 24/7 and has wonderful food. My personal favorite is the BBQ Chicken Baker. Another popular favorite is the Chicken Fingers and Fries. I have had both and they taste great! It is not expensive and almost the same as eating everywhere else. But it also depends on what is ordered. Al's also takes Blazer Bucks. \r\n\r\nThese are the closest and most popular eating places on campus. I hope you enjoy the food!    "

I have also been in very small classes and never spoken to the professors. All in all, the professors are very accessible and happy to help you. The academic program at UAB is kind of tedious, but in the end you will have a greater knowledge base and will be more prepared for grad school or professional school.

In-class discussions have fueled the majority of my college education. From honors courses to English courses to Spanish courses, I've been required to speak at length on topics, which made me an expert in the field when I came out of the class. It's truly a great feeling to be able to talk at length about something academic and know that you know what you're talking about.

There's not a day that goes by that there's not a guest lecture, performer, or some sort of group activitiy going on on campus. I am pretty involved on campus, and I met a lot of my friends through the groups to which I belong. Getting involved is important at any campus, but I think UAB makes each group feel like they matter--there isn't a real hierarchy among groups. Yes, some groups have more funding, but that doesn't mean that they're necessarily better than other groups. There's not a Greek/nonGreek war going on, either. The Greeks are just other student organizations, and they work with everyone to do good things in our community.

But, one parking lot is about to get demoed and the new Humanities Building is going to be built there. I have had many many classes in the Humanities Building, and it does need to be rebuilt.

The only thing I would even consider changing is the fact that there are not many over street passes so that students can navigate the urban campus easier.

There's really nothing like learning Spanish literature or film from a native speaker who is an expert in their particular speical topics field. Similarly, there's nothing like learning about archaeology in an honors seminar from an archeaologist who can speak about her experiences abroad.

I know you feel pretty bummed out about not getting any of the scholarships you applied for, or not getting the highest ACT score out of all your friends, but remember, none of that measures your worth as a person. When you get to UAB you'll meet plenty of other kids just like you, and not getting the scholarships you wanted then just serves as motivation to keep trying for the future. You'll get a scholarship some day. You're still a smart, beautiful, and amazing young girl, and I'm just as proud of you then, as I am of us now. You learn that UAB was a great choice for you, and you don't regret your choice at all. Keep up the good work girl. Love you. \n - Khari",
                "Savannah": "Going into college, I was leaving all my friends behind. My greatest fear was that I was not going to be accepted by others the way that I was accepted by my old friends. I was afraid because I do not drink or go to parties, and college was known for its parties. I didn't want to become someone I wasn't. I wanted to be loved and accepted no matter what my actions were. If I could go back and talk to my high school self, I would tell myself to trust in God more and to not worry because I am not by myself. When I got to college I realized that many other students prefer not to drink. I was blessed with an abundance of friends who stayed home and studied with me on a friday night. I wish I could go back and make myself less stressed as a high school senior because now I know that college is going to be the best years of my life.",
                "Christina": "If I could go back in time and offer advice to my former self, I would definitely tell my high school self to be prepared and focused for college. I believe that many people initially think of college as the chance to be free and therefore, do not have limits. The person I am now, older and a bit wiser, would tell my younger self that the main objective for attending college is to obtain a degree to have a greater chance of securing the success of my future. I would put much emphasis on this when speaking to my high school self.",
                "Julie": "Don't take everything so seriously.  Be ready to laugh at yourself.  Don't spill your life story to everyone you talk to.  Be cautious until you really get to know someone.  Don't overreact when someone hurts you.  At best, you'll have to apologize to someone.  At worst, you'll lose a friend.  Don't worry about how many friends you have.  Not everyone can be a social butterfly.  It is best not to get loaded at parties.  Alcohol makes people stupid.  Be kind to yourself even if other people aren't.  Remember why you are there (at college):  to learn.  Homework and studying ALWAYS come first.",
                "Maegan": "Dear High School Maegan, \nCollege is coming. It's coming fast and it will be here before you know it. Although it is scary at first, it will be the best time of your life. It may not be one of your top priorities right now, but I think you should visit as many college campuses as possible. I really love my school, but sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice. Also, apply for as many scholarships as possible! They may not seem very important right now, but when tuition is due, scholarships help more than you could imagine. Most importantly, do not lose your values. College is full of temptation, frustration, and new experiences. Above all, do not lose who you are and what you believe in. Sometimes it is the best choice to not fall into peer pressure and to create your own path. Always keep your final goal in mind, stay optimistic, and put all of your faith in God.",

                "Tierra": "From freshmen to senior year, I was a participant in my high school\u2019s International Baccalaureate (IB) program. This enabled me with the opportunity to earn college credit through pre-college courses; if given enough credits, I could have entered my first semester of freshmen year at the University of Alabama at Birmingham as a second semester sophomore. Unfortunately because of the choices I made, I did not receive my IB diploma. By not prioritizing my time to study for my IB exams, this caused too low scorings on my exams to receive college credit and my IB diploma. If I could talk to my high school senior self, I would beat into my head how important it is for me to earn my IB diploma. I would stress myself about studying for those exams because now I\u2019m retaking and paying money for classes I have already taken in high school. My high school self would know the expenses I have to pay now with being an out-of-state student and how getting my diploma would save me thousands of dollars that could go toward Medical School in the future.",
                "Shenique": "Dear high school senior me, \nCollege is a place to finally embrace yourself. You no longer have to pretend to be something you're not because your \"friends\" don't accept the real you. By the way, you probably won't hear from anybody you went to high school with after the first month of college. Remember when you were going to apply for all these ivy league schools? You should've because you were smart enough and just as determined as anybody else. Don't put yourself down, you weren't just smart but you studied, neglected your social life and it paid off because you are going to make the honor graduate selection. By the way, I wish you would've used those scholarship lists and applied. Just because a person is smart doesn't mean that money falls in their lap. You have to apply against a thousand other qualified students. Even though there won't be a next time, have a plan A, B, and Z school choice; plan Z as in the plan when everything that could posibly go wrong will!!! Lastly, college is so full of freedom, enjoy it!\nWith love,\n College You",
                "Danielle": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior, I would give myself three pieces of advice.  The three pieces of advice I would give myself would be to study harder, apply for more scholarships, and to focus on my goals and aspirations.\n           The first piece of advice would be to study harder.  By studying harder, I could have made better grades my freshmen year in college, which would have allowed me to earn more scholarships and helped to better prepare for med school in the future.  Studying harder would have given me the work ethic required to become successful in every aspect of my life.  \n            The second piece of advice  would be to apply for more scholarships.  Applying for more scholarships would have made college a smoother experience.  By applying to scholarships, the cost of tuition would have drastically decreased and would have elimated the struggle and anxiety that is caused by student loans and debt.\n           The third piece of advice is to focus on my goals and aspirations.  Being career-focused would allow planning for my future and would give peace of mind when the goal is completed.",
                "Em": "During my senior year, I felt so hopeless that I couldn't even bring myself to be excited about moving away for college. Being at the end of a toxic relationship that ended up terminating most of the friendships I'd had since middle school, not being able to be out as queer to my parents, and struggling with an ED, it was hard for me to see past all the bad that was in front of me and look forward to a future of endless possibility. If I could go back in time and tell myself one thing, cliche as it sounds, it would be to let myself know that things were going to become so indelibly great that in a year's time-- that I'd be a completely different, wholly better person with goals, accomplishments, and a great job at an NPR news station. While I know none of this ever could've happened if it wasn't for the long road that brought me here, if my high-school self had even had an inkling of how great things were going to be, I think I could've saved myself a lot of trouble.",
                "Nicole": "If I could go back to when I was a senior in High School and give myself some advise it would be to work on my organization and time management skills. In college, every time you turn around there's a new deadline coming up, a project due, and a test to study for. I would tell myself to go ahead and make a panner my best friend because keeping up with so much work for so many different classes is hard to do. I would also tell myself to learn to be more organized, to keep all my flash cards and notes from different classes, because you never know when you're going to need your old notes. But the most important thing I would tell myself is not to procrastinate. College tests are nothing like the ones in high school where you could study the night before and make an A. I would tell myself to start studying for any test atleast two weeks in adavance.",

Newsflash, things seem to be pretty great the older you get. College is indeed as hard as you thought it would be, if not harder. Those classes you used to get by in by doing the bare minimum? Change those habits now before you go to college. College requires hard work, effort, and studying\u2014just doing well enough will not work, and that top ten percent GPA of yours will suffer. Those assignments you used to do on your own? College changes your mentality about teamwork completely. It is impossible to make it through college without the help of a few, or a lot, of your classmates. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together\u201d stops becoming a Disney clich\u00e9 and becomes a true statement. You are going to be fine, and you will adjust just fine to the big university. As you move on to this next transition in life, move with poise, positivity, and persistence. Take a deep breath and fluff your hair\u2014the next four years are going to be amazing.",
                "Candeis": "Ok, you are a high school senior now.... What's next?? I know that question is daunting right now but must be considered. Please take some time out and do a lot of research on different career paths. I think it would be wise if you did some shadowing on different careers to grasp an idea of what each entails. Once you have shadowed a few professions, start working on your networking skills. It is helpful to know people who are in your field of study. Additionally, I think it would be in your best interest if you purchased a planner and started working on being organized; that will help you tremendously. College is tough but you can do well if you apply yourself. After working on becoming organized, start applying for scholarships, college is expensive and will not pay for itself. Last but most importantly, start now! Break your awful habit of procrastination. It is a terrible habit and will only harm you in the long run. Read before class and take notes, ask questions if you don't understand the material and if you optimize your opportunities to learn, you will excel.",

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, make them early in the game and be the first one to own up for them. Be aware you are going to make many mistakes, but it's okay because it is a part of transitioning into independence. You go one day from showing up at the dinner table with your mom's cooking waiting, and then struggling to buy a can of soup nearly overnight. These struggles will only help you grow, and give some fun stories to share with your friends. In addition, try the things you are afraid of immediately. You will be surprised to learn that the things you feared most happened to be the very first things you fall in love with. Calculus being the main example. And also  remember that unfortunately you have not figured out life's meaning yet, I'm sure that must be disappointing. However, don't worry, you'll grow to be happy with the realization that you know nothing. The journey becomes more interesting then.",
                "Rachel": "Get focused early. It is alright to get out and explore being on your own, but don't allow this to hinder your schoolwork. Take every class seriously, even electives. Just because you can skate by and still pass doesn't mean you should take that route. Remember, that A that you could have earned had you tried your best will be useful in cushioning your GPA later in your college career when the course load gets harder. The more hours accumulate, the harder it is to raise your GPA. Give yourself a fair chance. Start reaching out to companies you would like to work for early. Volunteer or get involved in an internship. You will need these references later, not to mention the experience will be beneficial to your resume. Get out and make friends. All work and no play will drain you and cause loss of motivation. Surround yourself with positive individuals who want you to succeed and who know when and how to relax. When you look back on your college experience, you not only want to be able to say you did well in class, but also that you made long-lasting relationships. Best of luck!",
                "Queen": "If I could go back in time to talk to my high school senior self I would give the advice, of patience, self motivation, and open-mindedness. Where college is a new and open world to most people who enter it, it is important to make a smooth transition on an individual\u2019s way to adulthood while in this environment. Patience is key, the difficulty of making new friends with diverse groups of people, and also academically, where one could not get an answer or assistance in an instance. Self motivation, because my old environment was made up of adults who forced motivation, where in college, where almost every aspect of the learning process is completely left upon the student, motivation becomes difficult, but I must become independent and motivate myself, and not rely on figure heads or others to do the motivation for me, because that option will not always be there. Lastly open-mindedness, where high school introduced you to the world, college life constantly causes you to submerse yourself completely into new people, experiences, and ideology.",

It is ok if you do not know what you want to major in. Spend as much time as you can with your friends and family your senior year because soon everyone will be moving. College classes are like taking all AP classes and your teachers in college will not babysit you and they do not care if you skip class that just hurts you. Stop worring about relationships in high school and sex because really it is over rated and you spent way too long worring about boys then working on class work. Retake any AP tests if you can because it can be worth money the $100 or college credit. Just take a breathe and stop trying to rush into college and growing up. Take it slow.",

I would also stress to myself to stay motivated and don\u2019t get too much senioritis because many people and organizations are willing to award me for my hard work and diligence in high school.

In retrospect, I would have spent more time asking my guidance counselor questions about colleges and methods of paying for college.

There are so many scholarships available, one just has to take the time to complete the application or essays. Also I would also tell myself that it doesn't matter if you are not completely sure what your career choice is when you first enter college.

I'd tell myself that studying is the key, I can't party all night and plan on taking a test that I tried to study for a few hours before the test and expect to pass. That does not work in college. Also, learn to manage my time wisely. I always find myself saying there arent enough hours in a day but it is only because I don't really didn't learn time management until I got to college. Last thing is do not try to work a full time and go to school fulltime like in high school, it does not work!",

Do not think the friends that you talk to in high school will be your friend in college. People change and you will meet new people at college.

Before I finally decided to attend UAB, I wanted to go to Vanderbilt University.  I loved the setting and the professors from when I took a summer program called PAVE.  Now, I feel like I made the perfect decision to attend UAB because I am already in an honors college, president of a club, and on the Dean's List.  I feel so comfortable in Birmingham knowing that I have scholarships to pay for my tuition and housing.\nAlso, I would tell myself to learn my study habits before I attend college.  In high school, I studied everyday after school and completed all of my homework.  Now in college, I do homework in the mornings, afternoons, and mostly nighttime.  My schedule is always different each semester, and sometimes I have morning classes or night classes.  By learning my study habits, I will find the best time for me to study.  If I had known that earlier, I would not have experimented for weeks in my freshman year trying to learn the part of the day I study the best."

Also, whereas it is a good school, it is not as expensive as some universities can be. Plus the campus is nice, clean, and safe.

However, I have found that there is a larger majority of geeks, nerds, hip/hop listeners, and all sorts of other types of students along those lines.

If they do want to attend a professional school, they're aren't always your cookie-cutter biology majors. A girl in my honors program designed her own major--medical illustration. She loves art and she wants to be a doctor, so she combined the two. Medicine and medically-related fields aren't all UAB has to offer--I'm an English major, and I think I've received a wonderful English education at UAB. The faculty have worked with me since freshman year, and I really think I've grown as a reader and a writer. UAB isn't just a path to medical school--it's a path to whatever career you desire!",

I strongly reccomend going to classes early during those times in order to find a place to park.  Also, park legally...UAB and Birmingham will ticket you any and every chance they get.",
