Now that I have been at ucla for a quarter, I don\u2019t understand why I wanted to get in so badly.  I really do not understand why kids from out of state would choose to attend ucla (not worth the $$$).   Now that the omicron variant is taking off, I\u2019m glad I get to take classes at home like I did during most of my education at community college.  This experience has made me realize that I like community college more.  And this is not because I struggled academically, I did very well my first quarter here.  It\u2019s more the rest of the college experience that I do not particularly enjoy.  Maybe this review is just hating on college in general, but my college happens to be ucla.  "

The students are generally very friendly and down-to-earth. I've thoroughly enjoyed all my professors this quarter. Classes are rigorous, and some are tough. Yet, succeeding in them simply requires a set schedule, discipline, and effort. Make sure to attend office hours and review sessions! Remember God put you in this school for a reason. Do your part, and everything will turn out fine!"

But what truly makes UCLA special isn't just how incredibly gorgeous our university grounds are,  the caliber of our professors, the huge number of events and activities that happen on and off campus weekly to help round out your life beyond academics, or the feeling you get when doing an 8 clap with thousands  of other students at a football game. What makes UCLA my happiest place on earth are the students.  This university is home to some of the most collaborative students you will ever meet. I like to say that I've learned more than I ever thought possible through my classes, however, I've probably learned twice as much from my peers. People are excited to share their passions with you and I promise you that you'll find yourself excited about some topic that you had never even heard of before a classmate mentions it. UCLA students are inspiring, driven, intelligent, and one of a kind, and they made attending this university the best four years of my life."

It's always exciting leaving the dorms because you know that something fun is happening outside.  Granted, it can be overwhelming the first week because of how many options you have to study or party, so be cautious about how you spend your time. Overall, it is a great campus with great academic and social opportunities that will never fail to excite you."

Cal state la  is mostly a commuter campus because it's in the area but I feel that students should get more involved in school events and activities to get the full college experience. I can't wait to see how my other three years here at cal state la go I'm excited!

            "Describe the dorms. ": {
                "Yifang": "There are three dorm options offered: residential halls, plazas, and suites.\r\n\r\nThe residential halls are the cheapest. Most rooms are triples (meaning three people live in them), while doubles are less common, and singles are even less common. Of the four residential halls on campus, Dykstra Hall is the oldest and the most social. This is where I lived my freshman year, and I knew all 100 people on my floor, though I wasn't necessarily close to everyone. While Dykstra is generally known as the \"freshman hall,\" it will be undergoing renovation this year (2012), since it hasn't been renovated since the 60s. (I have a friend whose dad went to UCLA and lived in Dykstra. He claims the rooms were doubles during his stay and that the rooms haven't gotten a single coat of paint since then.) The new \"freshman hall\" is Hedrick Hall, which just reopened this year, after renovations. While I haven't gone inside, I've heard that it's very nice. There are two communal bathrooms on each floor. While the floor is co-ed, the rooms are not. (So if you're a girl, your roommates will also be girls.)\r\n\r\nYour second option is the plazas. These are similar to the residential halls, but they have their own private bathroom, which get cleaned weekly. While I haven't lived in the plazas myself, I've heard they're less social, which can be good if you want to focus on your studies, but bad if you're a first year and you want to meet people.\r\n\r\nThe third option, the suites, is even more isolated. The two suite complexes on the Hill (what we call the area where all the dorms are) are fairly far away from everything else, including the main campus. These are great places to get your work done, since they're even less social than the plazas, but again, not an ideal place to meet people as a first year. One suite consists of two bedrooms, a living room, and a bathroom. You can have as many as six people living in one suite (three per bedroom), and like the other dorms, they are single-gender only.",

These groups can develop into your circle of friends and become the group that you hang out with the most.

And much like the city in which it resides, this would be an advantage if it wasn't also deeply segregated.  Every single ethnic group has a corresponding extracurricular club that in effect (and probably not intentionally) divides the student body into hundreds of fragmented sub-groups organized around ethnic identity. There's a South Indian Dance and Culture Club, there's a Central American Heritage Initiative group, there's an Afro-American Evangelical Christian Ministry Step Dance Ensemble,  there's a Mandarin Only A/V Club... in other words, a lot of student life centers on race.  UCLA as an institution and as a student body is obsessed with race and ethnic identity. Not that this is unusual for a school or negative for the student body, but as an example, a true disadvantage comes when I go to the most diverse school in the most diverse city in the country and by the end of it I only know white poli-sci majors from San Luis Obispo.  The great advantage of attending an extremely diverse campus comes from the social and intellectual contact and discourse between groups and people of differing backgrounds learning and exploring together.  In practice, this is not how it actually works here. There is not significant contact between these groups.  This is only natural considering most of them have nothing in common with the other groups enough to sustain any meaningful contact.  For example, you're not gonna see the Bruin Republicans and the Arab Student Alliance playing ultimate frisbee at Drake Stadium.  This fragmenting is probably due to the fact that UCLA is a large school with a large student body and people tend to form micro-groups within any organization that large, and those groups tend to organize around race/identity.  I understand the need for this sub-grouping, but it is a shame, because I believe that at a campus this large, to the detriment of all students, this is really just auto-segregation.  \n\nAn interesting glimmer of hope; there are TONS of courses offered on this very thing.  Students of all backgrounds are encouraged to take early chicano lit or subjects in Sub Saharan Economies of the 20th Century or a variety of super unique courses that bridge the gaps between cultures and local histories, and it is in these classrooms and study sections where the real discourse occurs.  Unfortunately, I've found that many of the students here are too involved in their own ethno/political club activities to give a shit about intellectual discourse.  Others of course are the super driven type that make everybody else feel like they need to do the readings again. In summary, MOST of the student body here is HIGHLY annoying and fragmented into thousands of ethno-special sub categories completely tangential to academics, intellectual discourse, or other cliched constructs of what is now known in America as \"college life.\"",

There is an entire WORLD east of Fairfax, and I'm not just talking about Hollywood (which is highly overrated anyway).  Don't be afraid of downtown, check out the east side and learn everything you can about the subway and where it goes.  You should not ever leave LA or college in LA without experiencing Griffith Park, Hollywood Bowl, MOCA, Natural History Museum, Downtown, Echo Park street food, Elysian Park, Los Feliz independent shops, Boyle Heights' insane Mexican food... I could go on.  But please, if you don't have a car, there are MANY buses that will gladly take you away from the Westwood bubble, and if you do have a car.... you have no excuse but your own pathetic xenophobia.

I felt that UCLA was more a leader of culture and community and challenged the status quo than other schools I considered.

Also, we have a great athletic program and a diverse campus with all kinds of interests... and we all get along, for the most part!

Often the students that stay indoors or in the library 24/7 are the ones that do not enjoy their stay here at UCLA, but in reality UCLA has more to offer than I've heard of at most campuses. Most of the students are smart (they did get into UCLA of course) and the competition can lead to a smaller amout of social time, but I've found that most of the students (especially in Greek Life) live by the work hard play hard mantra. We have 100 national championships for sports and although our football team has been weak the past few years we deffinately are not the \"less athletic\" campus in LA. Our basketball team is amazing and we have championship womens water polo and both men and women's volleyball teams. As you can also tell, the pre-meds aren't just work either.

                "Toby": "ABSOLUTELY! Every SINGLE one of them. If you ask me, some of them give UCLA even more credit than it deserves. \r\n\r\nI was told during campus tours, recruiting events, and freshman orientation that it was nothing but a rumor that UCLA students are treated as no more than a number. Then, when school began and I immediately WHOLE bunch of other crap, it didn't take long to realize that the few people available to speak to were so overwhelmed with other students' problems that I would be forced to figuratively- and sometimes literally- sit and wait for my number to be called. Rumor my ASS. \r\n\r\nOh, and the student body- what a terribly lovely bunch. I could probably expound on this topic indefinitely, but I would hate to be cruel. Therefore, I will give you the extremely abbreviated (and admittedly grossly generalized)version of my overarching view of the UCLA student population.\r\nUCLA's students can be roughly divided into four groups. First, there are the athletes, but the general population doesn't really know much about them, nor does it interact with them very often. They stay to themselves, indulging in all the benefits student aid and a disgustingly large portion of the school's funding brings to them. They seem a happy bunch. Then, there are those in the Greek system. While a great deal more lively than most on campus, those in fraternities and sororities are a bit... warped. Let me explain. You see, the frat boys and sorority girls, on the whole, were obviously of average social standing in their high schools. They weren't part of the in-crowd, nor were they among the extremely attractive, outgoing, or well-known. Still though, they were nothing to be scoffed at. Decent-looking, interesting enough, and extremely intelligent, these students most likely occupied the part of their high school student body that no one noticed too much, and therefore never had much of an opinion either way about. Then they came to UCLA, and oh BOY! All of a sudden, thrown into a sea of pasty intellectuals and extreme book nerds- a sea ENTIRELY devoid of makeup, fahsion sense, and muscle definition- these average-loooking schmos really started to shine, and they knew it. Now, they have banded together, and O, do they think themselves great. Whether they're strutting around talking on their phones and making sure everyone in the surrounding area knows JUST how CRAZY their last night out was, giving the right looks to make sure that others know that they're of a league too great to be spoken to, or in the gym either doing cardio in sports bras and full makeup or lifting foolishly heavy weights and grunting just loudly enough so that everyone in the damn place can look over and see JUST how much weight they're lifting, you'll always know a frat guy or a sorority girl at UCLA. And if you're blind and deaf, just follow the smell of asshole. Now, this leaves two more groups... kind of. The first of these takes up the largest and most visible portion of UCLA's student body- a good 70%, I'd say. These are the people that you couldn't even IMAGINE caring about. Sure, they're smart. Sure, they're PROBABLY nice. BUT, has an interesting word EVER come out of their mouths? Has an interesting thought ever even been formed in their HEADS?! Most likely not. If NEGATIVE personality (as in not just the lack of personality, but the OPPOSITE of it) were something able to be measured and added, the amount one could find at UCLA would reach a sum too great for even the school's greatest plasmologists to comprehend. It's sad, really. The last group, we could basically just call \"the rest.\" The people in this group are only those who couldn't really be placed in any of the others, on account of some quirk or abnormality. Of course, it is in this- the smallest of all groups- that you would be likely to find a person worth your time. And if you're looking, I wish you luck. I have found one in my two years in this hellhole, and thank goodness for her! At least that means there's hope.\r\n\r\nAs for the overcrowding, just look at the stats. They don't lie.

Although, many UCLA students took to setting fires on to sofas on the streets of Westwood after the 2006 Football Victory over USC in their fit of celebration. It is hard not to get roped in so I ended up yelling harmless but demeaning remarks at the USC players and students on T.V. (but this is not an indication that I hate them).

The professor doesn't know your name (how can he?), and people really don't care if you show up or not. Because we're on the quarter system, classes go by really fast. It's good if you don't like a class, because you're done with it after 10 weeks, but if you don't actually know what's going on, then you can fall behind really quickly. \r\n\r\nAs a biochemistry student, I haven't taken many humanities classes, so I can't speak for them, but as far as the science classes go, they're competitive. My classmates study all the time. They go to office hours whenever they're available, and they're constantly trying to get a good grade in the class. Our classes are all lecture-based, so there's absolutely zero participation (unless you have a question to ask), but I know that in the English classes, it's all discussion-based. \r\n\r\nWhile all the professors are extremely accomplished, some are simply better at teaching than others, at which point, it's up to you to figure out the material.

You get out of your classes what you put into them - lecture attendance is rarely required, but going often, and developing a relationship with the professor in office hours, will ensure a more worthwhile use of your time and money (and a better grade).

It really is strange how different classes are between campuses. \r\nSouth Campus- huge 300 people lectures. Want to get to know the professor? You need to WERK! You need to take initiative, take advantage of his office hours, ask questions! Usually, math classes SUCK and the professors are too smart for their own good and don't know how to explain theories to us normal folk. But the science classes like chem and bio are organized and students know they have to form study groups. \r\nNorth Campus- smaller lecutures (100-200?) and VERY intimate and helpful discussions. Discussions are the smaller division of student classes lead by a teachers assistant, and you really get to know everyone in your discussion, but each discussion heavily depends on the TA. You definitely should try asking around to see which TAs grade better or teach better- it can make or break you!\r\n\r\nI'm pre-med and switching between psychobiology or psychology major.

I've taken GE classes in many north campus classes, and the majority of them have a lot of reading. So be prepared to read at least 200 pages a week. For science classes, you take the core classes with hundreds of other students, and depending on the professor, they can be your most favorite or worst nightmare. Each professor has a different style of teaching, what they want to emphasize on, how hard they want to make the exams, how much homework they assign, and show if they care about student learning or not. It really all depends on the professor. I've had some so-so and some very awesome professors; how much you like the class really depends on the professor who teaches it. Some professors will make an effort to know your name, that is, if you try to know them yourselves and go to office hours.\r\n\r\nStudents who go here, worked hard in high school to get here, so they will definitely make sure they stay here and graduate. Everyone is studious, to some extent. Science classes are where you will find the most competitive students--mainly because the majority of them are pre-med, pre-dent, pre-pharm, etc. The student atmosphere also depends on which class you're taking. Some classes promote collaborative student learning while some others just end up being that you're learning on your own (if you have friends taking the same classes, then form study groups!

Therefore, asan undergrad in say physics, you are studying under a professor from one of the greatest physics departments in the country, and your being tutored by TAs who are themselves proteges of the top programs available to their discipline.  Think about that.  UCLA doesn't just have great Med/Law/Business schools, its individual programs are even HIGHER ranked.  So, regardless of your major, you're highly likely to be studying with the most esteemed intellectuals in that field, and under the tutelage of the most competent graduate students in the country.  Check mate USC, get back on the football field where you belong and stop trying to compete academically with the greatest school in southern California.",
                "Tanaya": "SOME professors actually do know your name, contrary to popular belief... it's all up to you whether or not you want to make yourself memorable by taking part in class and talking to your professor during office hours. A lot of my professors have had coffee and donuts hours, and other social events to better get to know their students. I'm currently taking one class that has 7 students, and another that consists of 15, so the myth that our classes are always huge and impersonal is not true, although the big lecture halls have their advantages, too. The academic requirements cover a wide range of topics and subjects, and sometimes there are things you'd think that were totally unrelated to your field that you have to take, but then later you realize why you needed to take them (or not!). Most of the classes have given me useful knowledge for the future, but a few have been a useless waste of time.",
                "Jason": "The academics are outstanding. They are so outstanding that despite everything else I've said, the professors, classes, and material here more than make up for everything else. I am gladly going into debt to sit at the foot of the masters here. \r\n\r\nOf course to get the experience, you have to plan and prioritize it. My major is in the social sciences. If you're like me, the best way to get a good experience is to enroll in more seminars than lectures. These classes are small and discussion based, somewhat student guided, and generally culminate in a substantial paper at the end. You get to have great interaction with professors and students at a higher level than in other classes. This is important because in larger classes, students tend to desperately swarm the professors at the end of every class in the vain hope that they will differentiate themselves and receive a letter of recommendation for law or grad school.",
                "Matthew": "UCLA is a very competitive school when it comes to academics.  Students study very often, especially the many pre-med kids, and class participation is fairly common.  Students carry on intelligent conversation outside of class, ranging from class topics to politics to philosophy.  The most unique class I have taken is Art and Archeology of Ancient Greece, which was really fascinating.  I loved learning about classical and bronze age Greeks, especially how the cultures developed over time.  Many major-specific courses are designed towards getting a job, but the wide variety of other classes enables learning for pleasure.",
                "Leah": "Academics at UCLA are excellent.  We have relatively small class sizes compared to most major universities, plus we have weekly discussion sections that have maybe 10-20 people in them, so each student gets as much attention as necessary from the professors and the TA's.  The professors here often know the names of the people in their classes.  \r\nThe thing that impresses me the most about UCLA is how willingly students participate in class.  That makes class much more interesting and creates an excellent learning environment.  In fact, the learning environment extends even outside of class.  There are student groups and activists all over campus that are glad to share their opinions AND hear ours.  \r\nThere are many unique classes here at UCLA, but one of the most unique is the Imagineering class.  It's a complete course on how to do what the Disney Imagineers do.  Its an incredible opportunity for any students who are interested in that field or in any engineering field in general.\r\nThe students here are quite competitive, especially in the south campus majors (sciences and math).  The departments are extremely helpful in getting you the information you need to know and helping you graduate in your projected window.  UCLA's academic requirements are rigorous, but manageable and it is always possible to graduate in 4 years if you plan them well.  \r\nThe education at UCLA is amazing.  It involves learning for the sake of learning in a program that takes you directly to your field of choice in the future.",
                "Lindsay": "GE classes at UCLA can be pretty large.  Even some of the classes for your major, it if is one of the more popular ones.  However, to counteract the size of the lectures, many courses have discussion sections where T.A.s help students with the material by getting them to talk about it.  So, even though your professor might not know who you are, if you are active in discussions, your T.A.s will and they can be a good source for letters of recommendation if you need them.\r\n\r\nMy favorite class has probably been one of the Honors Collegium courses offered.  It was about modern transformations of classical story forms - specifically it was the transformation of the Cinderella story and a transformation of Robinson Crusoe.  It was the first and only class where I actually liked writing my papers because I was actually coming up with my own thoughts rather than regurgitating what the professor in my class had told us.  I guess that excited me that I was able to discuss my own ideas and not be penalized for going off about what I think.\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness really seems to depend on the kinds of courses you are taking at UCLA.  If you are in a bio or chem class that is curved, the class is pretty much cutthroat in their acquisition of grades.  I have heard of \"friends\" denying to help each other for fear that one would do so much better than the other.  However, there is really nothing like this in the social sciences.\r\n\r\nThe first priority of a lot of the professors at UCLA isn't teaching, it is their research.  This should be kept in mind.  Although professors have office hours, it might be harder to get a hold of some of them beyond those times if you need to see them.\r\n\r\nEducation at UCLA seems very much like it is geared toward a professional career of some kind.  Most students here, if they know what they are going to do after graduation, seem to be on the path to become some kind of lawyer or doctor.",
                "Ryan": "I'm an English major so a majority of the classes are based around heavy discussion of texts. The professor's here are very helpful, both in class and during office hours. They make it so that the studen feels free to recieve help at any given time if confusion arises. There is an immense amount of studying and analyzing involved which would equate to about 4-5 hours daily in my case. The requirements are fair and it can definetly be managed thorugh out a 4 year period. The students in my department are very knowledgable, yet they seem to always find time to lend a helping hand outside of class. My favorite class so far would be English 141A: Canterbury Tales becuase the text we read was filled with some amazing imagery and themes. I feel that going to class here is really worthwhile and gives you a sense of comfort.",
                "Russell": "Professors will know your name if you raise your hand and are a good student.  My favorite classes have been the two classes I've taken that I anticipated to be the most boring: Introduction to Jewish Studies and 19th Century American History; Jewish Studies because I'm a Jew and therefore have a strong background in the information I would be learning, and History because well...come on, it's history.  The truth is, I could not have been more wrong.  Both professors retaught me how to think, encouraging the incorporation of viewing information as belief instead of fact and analyzing for what it can be instead of what it is.  Both professors knew my name because I raised my hand often and disagreed with their views even more often.  Both TAs (grad students) knew my name all through the courses and got me thinking even more than the professors did.  I met the professors and TAs outside of academic purposes a few times as well.\r\n\r\nMy least favorite class was Theater 20.  Now hold your horses, I LOVE acting, come on.  But the class was for non-majors, and the TA didn't seem to respect the students' potential very much.  I attribute this to the fact that our Theater school is one of the best in the nation.\r\n\r\nAll of my GE classes have been interesting and I've had great selection.  I took a class on music's influence on Religion in global cultures.  It was taught by a professor who was born in Macedonia, grew up in Croatia, spoke 7 languages, and had experienced and worshiped with virtually every religious tradition in existence as part of a life goal of hers.  THIS CLASS WAS A GE!!!  I learned a lot, despite her thick accent.\r\n\r\nDon't underestimate the power of ALL departments at UCLA.  There are no weaknesses (except Geology, I've heard?).  Engineering is top notch (I have friends pulling all nighters to write 30 page computer programs, so I know), humanities are well funded and attract thinkers from all over the country, sciences seem to attract a lot of professors who used to teach at MIT...weird, and the Arts are so comprehensive, I don't see how anyone could choose *cough* CAL *cough*.",
                "Lorie": "Not as hard as I expected - you can bullshit your way through a lot of classes.  the English department has some really great professors but the classes are pretty huge, so what you get out of it depends entirely on what you put into it.  if you want to get to know your professor, take the honors sections.  north campus students are not competitive in the ways south campus students are because we're not graded on a curve.",
                "Katherine": "As an english major, many of my pre-req. classes are large. I personally didn't make myself known to the professors, but I'm sure it could have been possible. The large lectures are usually divided into smaller sections taught by graduate student TA's, in a sense, it was kind of upsetting to have that personal discussion time with grad. students, but you come to find out that they are just as enlightening as the professors (however, some TAs aren't so good... so its kind of a toss up). It seems that most students are on the ball with their reading assignments, while I usually left them to the last minute, but I managed to maintain B's through most of my UCLA career! Class participation is fairly common and almost everyone seems to have something intelligent to add and a new perspective to give. The professors are wonderful, each have their own personality, but their knowledge is incredible! I don't see too much competition between the students since everyone, at this point, has learned to respect the other since we all had to meet the same requirements to get here! The requirements, at the transfer level, are totally \"doable\". I transferred! At the high school level, I think it's ridiculous, but all colleges have gotten to that point pretty much. The english major in itself is such a great major, it seems more like learning for it's own sake but what you learn is really applicable to ANY job. The english major gains knowledge in analyzing and reading between the lines, our reading comprehension and grammar skills are exercised and we learn how to construct successful arguments based on specific evidence, all of which can be applied to almost any career choice - and it allows for the flexibility of switching careers paths while in college (as is almost inevitable for most students)!",
                "Harper": "If you want your professor to know your name, s/he will. It's difficult in the really big classes, but UCLA has been around for a long time, and so they mostly have it down when it comes to getting what you want out of your education. The academic requirements, however, can be rigid and hard to deal with, especially if you want to try and craft you own major. Then, beware!",
                "Yvette": "unless u meet with a professor outside of class or you have a small discussion, it is highly unlikely that your teacher will know you by name. my favorite class so far was EDU-130, it was extremely interesting and i learned so much. i highly recommend it even if your not planning on teaching. least favorite ENGLISH 109, my teacher is all high and mighty and really mean, but the readings for the class are excellent. i'm going to say the study workload depends on the major, i study like 15 hours per week, south campus majors which are sciences and math majors probably need more since their classes are extremely competitive.  students here are VERY competitive! especially in the math and sciences. the most unique class i have taken so far was The Cultural History of Rap. it wasn't something i was very interested in, but i learned a lot about black arts movement, i know a lot of random facts that surprise the people who are interested in hip hop. it was pretty fun. my major is not super competitive but its not, not competitive either. it is very difficult and i don't think english majors get enough credit. its all critical thinking and its the hardest thing i have ever had to do. the Academic requirements are fair, its a tough school, they need to know that you can hang with the big dogs. getting a job or learning? i think it depends on what you study its both i think. we are prepared for anything.",
                "Sarah": "The Spanish Department here is a bit of a joke. Last year had a ton of really great professors and really great courses, but this year the department has just gone downhill. It's horrible with communication and has pretty much messed up the schedules of a ton of seniors because of certain classes not being offered enough that are needed to graduate.  Some professors are really great and are actually really focused on trying to get students to learn as opposed to just ranting and raving about how much they hate the administration and how they'd just rather go back to Spain.",
                "Joseph": "Professors are all different. I've heard of some professors memorizing an intire class of 60 people's names by the end of the first week and using them often. Others, like my lower division chem classes, are 300 student lectures were personal touches don't always exist. For the most part, when you get into your major and are taking upper division classes you become a lot more personal with professors and they often learn a lot about you.\r\n\r\nFavorite class - Neuroscience 102 with Dr. Arnold Sheibel - The most difficult and most rewarding class I have taken at UCLA. Dr. Sheibel is a living legend and at around 85 years old he is still the most well mannered, most articulate, and inpirational teacher I have had at UCLA\r\n\r\nWorst class - 9 am multivariable calculus class with a teach that had a monotone voice and a thick accent.\r\n\r\nStudy time varies by major, carrer choice, and intelligence but many students do make time to study vigorously. Thankfully, there are so many students at UCLA that when you are done studying or just need a break there is always someone ready to go out and have fun with you.\r\n\r\nUCLA students are often students first so conversations outside of class are often (or at least more often than at other schools) intelligent in nature. \r\n\r\nUCLA is very competative in cerain majors. This has hurt my GPA, but my bedside manner and people skills I have aquired outside of the classroom will deffinately pay off during interviews.\r\n\r\nThe neuroscience major at UCLA is difficult but rewarding. The information you learn is all cutting edge and neuroscience is one of the great frontiers that still has much potential for more knowledge compared to macrobiology and anatomy. The concelor is amazing and the teachers are very supportive and intelligent.",
                "Tate": "Professors did know my name - but that's because I worked for some of them in the Communications Department as a grader, so I spent time with them outside of calss as well.  One of my favorite classes was the History of American Film, which I think is a staple at UCLA.  Even though the class is four hours long (twice a week) it always fills up the quickest, mostly because people probably want to watch movies.  I don't recall a least favorite class.  Class participation is common, and I think the level of competition varies in different majors.  The Comm Dept was very relaxed.  The education at UCLA is definitely geared at learning for its own sake - which I think is good, because the things that we need to learn to get a job or do a job dont require much skill or thought.",
                "Dan": "Classes at UCLA are best described as impersonal and labor-intensive.  It is generally up to the student to take initiative and responsibility to ensure his/her own academic success, but again, help is easily found by the outgoing student.  Office hours and various discussion sections offer smaller-group environments to assist learning for students and most professors are more than willing to help an eager student.  That being said, most classes are very competitive, often absurdly so, by students used to striving to get an \"A\" at any cost.  Depending on the major, coursework is often undertaken with a \"run before youc an walk\" attitude due to the quarter system in which classes last only 10 weeks before completion.  For students interested in small classroom environments and close supervision, UCLA may not be an encouraging place to attend.",
                "Andrea": "Our general ed classes are huge, but thats probably true at most universities. Once you get further into your major though, classes get smaller and more personal. Im not one to see professors outside of class, but I know that they are available if you need them.",
                "Terry": "As a science major, I have yet to take a small class where the professor learns my name like in high school classes. I have personal relationships with only TA's, no professors, as classes are too large to bother. You would easily be able to find someone who studies all the time, and someone who never does - the whole spectrum of student type is represented here.",
                "Charlie": "No. My favorite class is social psychology. Least favorite is physics. Every day. Yes. Yes. YES. Eng 4W. I hate chemistry! No. They're cool. It's geared toward whatever you make it. Getting a degree from UCLA in and of itself isn't all that bad though. =)",
                "Becky": "Professors definitely do not know my name, but that is because I don't go to office hours and classes are pretty big. Students definitely have intellectual conversations outside of class, which largely revolve around stuff we're learning, but it's not what we spend all our time doing (we don't often sit around with coffee and discuss the meaning of life). The most unique class I've taken was the history of science, magic, and religion; we're pretty sure the proessor was a witch.",
                "Emily": "I feel that academics at UCLA are truly based on the individual student. Your professor will know your name if you take the time to get to know the professor. You will find your self in classroom discussions if you are willing to participate yourself. Some students study for hours and hours a week, for others a few hours is enough. And I truly believe that good grades are attainable for those that are willing to put in the effort required.",
                "Greg": "1. more do now 2. haven't categorized my classes that carefully 3. depends on the students 4. varies with the class and the professors 5. yes 6. premeds more than engineers 7. nothing pops out 8. civil and environmental engineering 9. yes 10. fairly strict 11. more towards theory",
                "Tristan": "Professors do not know very many names of students. Lectures are enormous, but reasonably so. It's understandably impersonal in this sense, but nevertheless I don't feel like \"just a number.\" Competition is only evident in the classrooms; people study and perform well on exams, making it to do well unless you yourself bring yourself to the same standard and study hard.",
                "Erin": "Some of them.\r\nAnthro 12- the honors section. It was me, three other girls, and a world renowned anthropologist. Once in a life time experience... and we got to go to the zoo!\r\nLeast fav.: trying to get into lower division poli sci classes is like trying to win a car race with a bicycle.\r\nMost weekends, maybe three weekdays a week.\r\nYes. Well, no. It depends on the class size/how intimidating a professor/TA is.\r\nWe have great discussions outside of class; they're not all intellectual, but every so often something intelligent sneaks in.\r\nVERY competitive.\r\nMost unique class: History of Magic, Science, and Religion. But I don't recommend it.\r\nPolitical Science and Psychology happen to be the two most popular majors on campus. They're crowded and hard to get into--- but! that means there's the biggest range of class topics. I can literally take a class on whatever I want to study.\r\nNot really.\r\nThe requirements are fair, but hard to make them work with one another sometimes.\r\nLearning for its own sake. but that's got a lot to do with my majors-- neither is really made for a job just out of college.",
                "Michigan": "My most favorite class is my Honors Collegium seminar with Professor Von Blum.  He knows my name, but most professors don't know my name simply because of the size of most classes.",
                "antonio": "Some of the classes are pretty big..favorite class would have to be MAE 150A...students study pretty often but not so much that it takes up all their time...just gotta manage time well. Intellectual conversations...sure. Students are pretty competitive, but who isn't? Everyone wants to do well. Don't really spend time outside engineering with professors.. Academic requirement? Kind of geared towards both getting a job and theoretical learning for its own sake...way too many upper division requirements though.",
                "Tom": "You have to admit professors do not know your name in your beginning courses; but only if you sit there and do nothing. If you are involved in your academics and want the professor to know your name, he will, all you have to do is go to office hours, get some extra help. Use your professors not only as academic tools but as mentors as well. I am actually a GLOBAL STUDIES major and Geography major but I couldn't pick that from the list I had on this survey. It's awesome, the departement is great. THe international burkle institue is world renown and one of its former fellows is General Wesley Clark, former NATO supreme commander of allied foces in Europe!",
                "Bob ": "Nope my professors dont' know my name. It's kinda sad really, but I never have the bravery to go into office hours and introduce myself. It's nerve wracking to go into office hours. And yes, students are freaking insanely competitive here at this school - it borders on the ridiculous side. Biology is by far the chillest major but a lot of the snotty pre meds look down on it because it's \"easier\" than other things like Phy Sci or MCDB, but hey, I like animals and don't like narrowing my focus to something that I'll probably be studying when I'm in medical school.",
                "Alex": "the classes here are typically huge lecture halls but who cares really? academics rests in the hands of the student and if they want to be best friends with the prof, that is do-able, with office hours and the like. students here can be very competitive but it is usually easy to find help in class, and most people are laidback. class participation is not common but also not rare, it depends on the prof. i am a sociology major so my field of study involves how society works and how people interact, therefore a lot of the soc professors are very interactive and good communicators. ucla has a GE program that forces you to take a bunch of classes you otherwise wouldnt take, its painful at times but is a necessary evil that we all will someday appreciate. ucla has a lot of features that prep us for the real world as well, like career center, job fairs, internship fairs, and simply being in the los angeles area helps too.",
                "Jamie": "Professors do not know my  name because the classes are huge and I don't attend office hours (because I don't feel I need to). \r\n\r\nMy favorite class was physics because it explained the world to me in a scientific manner. I learned why things work the way they do. It seems applicable in the real world as well, not just for a career in physics. \r\n\r\nThe academic requirements for my actual major are fine, but I don't like having to take so many General Education requirements. Why can't they have a class on football? After all, they offer a lot of music history classes and movie classes, but no sport ones. Sports classes could include a lot of academic information: for instance, how sporting events have influenced history, strategies of playing the game, scouting, the physics of throwing a ball, etc.",
                "Diana": "In my lower division courses, none of my professors knew my name. I did have some good relationships with Teaching Assistants and now that I am starting to take upper division classes in an unimpacted major (linguistics), my professors actually know who I am and notice whether I am in class or not.",
                "Toby": "This is a tough subject for me to write about, because I can't quite tell if I have had an uncommonly poor experience with professors, or if everyone else is just too damn eager to succeed that they don't stop to ask why the hell they can't understand a damn thing they're being told. No one seems to be vocal as me about their dissatisfaction with the faculty, yet if you were to ask someone why they were struggling in their classes, that person would be likely to say that it is because their professor did an extremely poor job explaining it. You see, the greatest problem I have found with the professors is that, while they are EXTREMELY intelligent and competent people, they are interested primarily in the research being funded by the school, and have neither passion for teaching, nor the ability to do it. That leaves the TA's, who are often more interested in student learning, but who almost always use a very different method of explaning material than the professor. In fact, I have had a few TA's who don't even attend lecture. They merely take the topic being covered and find they quickest way to explain it to their students, who then often find themselves confused not only by the material itself, but also by the way in which they ought to go about handling it. There's also another big problem I've encountered with TA's (mainly in math and science courses), and this is kind of a touchy subject, so I'll do my best to be P.C. The majority of my TA's have been foreign. Okay, no problem. However, about half of these foreign TA's had such a poor grasp on the English language that they had trouble grasping some concepts (such as those in word problems), so students would have to explain them. Needless to say, this is not how the limited time of a discussion should be spent. And of course, many of these TA's had accents so thick that they would have to be asked to repeatedly repeat things so that students would understand. Honestly, I don't know what could be done about this problem, since someone should no be denied a position because of his or her background. Still, though, I think it does need to be acknowldged as a problem.",
                "Adam": "Some professors know me by name. Obviously, my fist 2 years it was rare that a professor would know me personally. Now that I am taking smaller classes, and the nature of the classes I take ( a lot based on discussions and interactions and opinions) you get to connect with your professors more. My favorite professors are either Getty or Lohmann. Getty teaches Soviet history and Lohmann teaches poli-sci with an emphasis on ethics. They both seemed genuinely interested in student learning over grades and had plenty of on-the field accounts to spice up lectures. Getty had incredible stories about times he met important players like Gorbachev and was easily the best lecturer ive ever had- he was realy old school. Lohmann is a gem- she is out of her mind and is obsessed with student interaction above all else. Some people can be annoyed by her tangents, but Im down. She really challenges you and grades are the last thing she worries about. I think her class is how university education should be.  My least favority courses are ones where it is obvious that the teachers dont want to be there. A lot of teachers are experts in their fields and do research, and they just dont seem to give effort to class. Jacoby Russel comes to mind...Students study a lot, but my major is unique in the sense that it is sorta easy to bullshit and not dso all the assigned reading. Oppose to something like physics, where I image it is a lot more studying. Intellectual conversations are common outside of class and sometimes creep into parties, but it is more about praising or talking shit about progfessors. I am a double major (history/polsci) and enjoy both. Like I said, UCLA is huge  and there are good professors and bad ones, finding and connecting with the good ones is key. The academic requirements are really that bad (but everyone complains about them). For me, I had no idea what I really wanted to study, so why not take a Bullshit science class???? They are for the most part easy and you meet people. Yeh, they are ultimately useless, but I guess I know about dinasours and nutrition now?? I think whether UCLA is geared towards getting a job or learning depends on the major and classes you take. History majors, for the most part, are interested in history and not necessarily concerned with a job.  Obviously, Law school is emphasized  in polisci courses, but it really depends on the professor.",
                "Jerry": "If you're in a small class, professors know your name, otherwise they won't. TA's will try to get to know you because you are in a smalelr class. My favorite class will probably have to be Life Science 15, and my least Computer Science 31. Students study when they need to study - for midterms, quizzes, homework, finals. Class participation is more common in smaller classrooms, and UCLA students definitely have intellectual conversations outside of class. Students are quite competitive, especially in my department. THe most unique class I've taken is Arts and Architecture. My major consists of 300 undergraduates, so there are less than 100 people per class, which means you can make strong connections with your peers. I spend time with some professors outside of class, such as my research professor - but mostly because I work with her. UCLA gears their education both on getting a job and learning for your own sake, because they teach what you want to know and what you should know.",
                "Cody": "Some do, lectures are dry for civil engineering, some students are hardcore studying, but i feel  most do just an adequate amount.",
                "Danielle": "It\u2019s a misconception\u2014even an excuse\u2014that the professors will not know your name.  Yes, there are enormous lectures, but I\u2019d rather be in a large lecture from a world-class professor than a seminar with someone less qualified.  The professor can and will get to know you if you make the effort.  Sitting in the front, raising your hand a few times, and attending office hours are small prices to pay for the recommendations and connections you could gain from the first-class professors at UCLA.  \r\nAs a north campus major, my classes subsist on a healthy balance of professor lectures and student discussions, usually both within the same hour period.  The academic expectations of UCLA translate into a competitive student body, which means that discussions can actually be useful.  And, while it may say something about my \u201cparty life\u201d, more often than not I find myself in intellectual conversations outside of class, because in the end, most of us got here and remain here because we value intelligent thought and discussion. \r\nUCLA has designed a totally optional one-year program for freshmen, a class known as a \u201ccluster\u201d, which focuses on a certain theme with multi-disciplinary approaches.  For example, I took one on \u201cHistory of Modern/Social Thought\u201d.  (Topics vary from \u201cThe 1960s\u201d to \u201cGlobal Environment\u201d, \u201cInterracial Development, etc.)  The class spans all three quarters, and features lecturers from related and overlapping fields\u2014my cluster was taught by professors and teaching fellows from the history, anthropology, philosophy, and sociology departments.  It was difficult, and intense, especially for a freshman, but I have used the knowledge I gained in that class in literally every class that has followed.  In addition, some perks include priority enrollment for cluster students and early training in seminar writing and discussion, which not only trains students for upper division classes but satisfies otherwise often tricky seminar  and writing requirements for the university.  I have recommended the cluster program to literally every student that I\u2019ve talked to about coming to UCLA.\r\nI came to UCLA as a physics major, impressed with and excited about the well-respected science department.  However, after a few quarters I realized that my strengths and interests lay instead in the English department.  I was incredibly satisfied, therefore, to experience UCLA\u2019s versatility, because the English department here is as world-renowned as its science department, if not more so, allowing me the same academic excitement that had brought me here on a different academic track.  My experience within the department has been quite inspiring, as I\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to study with some big names within the field.  I would stress the influence of the study abroad program within my major as well, because it\u2019s afforded me the opportunity to get to know some of these professors in a very focused setting, plus it\u2019s studying abroad.  It\u2019s been within seminar settings such as the study abroad classes that I\u2019ve been able to really experience some awe-inspiring intellectual discussions that ensure my enthusiasm for the subject.  After taking a Fiat Lux\u2014a small, one-unit, pass/fail class meant purely for fun\u2014I got to know the professor, who every summer took students to a major English conference for professors and graduate students, that we might get to observe, and participate in, a higher level of discussion than most undergraduates.  This experience allowed me to make the absolute most out of my major, and I\u2019ve been thrilled about studying English, with the UCLA English department, ever since.\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity for a student to make the most out of their major here, because all it takes is the time to get to know one professor, and suddenly a wide range of connections and opportunities opens.  I feel that individual departments are very good about rewarding those students that want to be there, and when you\u2019re already in a big pond, getting to be a big fish carries some considerable rewards and renown.  Thus, it\u2019s often easy to get a little intimidated by the minds teaching the classes\u2014for instance, when your professor has written the textbook which you\u2019re assigned\u2014but my experience has been that, during office hours or appointments, these world-recognized professors are here to encourage students to get as excited about their field as they are, and so they reward students who show a little more interest or willingness to do well.  The one thing to remember is that it\u2019s a student\u2019s responsibility to make him/herself memorable.  Sitting in the front is a small price to pay for a letter of recommendation from a top-ranked professor.  I\u2019ve gotten to know a few of my favorite professors by taking multiple classes from them, visiting their office hours to discuss everything from a specific paper thesis to my academic career and possible future opportunities.  Also, I\u2019ve had overall a pretty good experience with TA\u2019s, who, I\u2019ve found, are great sources of information on things like grad school, because they\u2019re so close to my own age and experience.  To sum up, the professors here, while they\u2019re gods during lecture, are approachable and helpful human beings as soon as you approach them as such.\r\nThanks to the academic rigor at UCLA, while each class is structured and taught as if it were learning for learning\u2019s sake, it\u2019s as effective and applicable to the working world as if it were taught that way.  Since our professors are so knowledgeable and our students so competitive, what feels like \u201clearning for learning\u2019s sake\u201d is effective job training in itself.  Some of the academic requirements have forced me outside my field of interests, but in hindsight I am glad that I\u2019ve had to take south-campus science and math classes despite their utter irrelevance to my future degree in British Literature.  The GE requirements are tedious at the outset\u2014they make schedule-planning seem like a chore and they often result in a lecture-long nap session.  But, every once in a while, a GE class in a field which you thought you disliked can offer some uncanny and interesting connections.  Luckily, the quarter system allies particularly well with GE requirements, because they go very quickly.  Also, with just a little bit of research or counseling, you\u2019ll find that there is more than one way to fill a requirement\u2014for me, History of Rock and Roll fulfilled a performing arts requirement, and Linguistics fulfilled a life science requirement, which means that even if your interests lie firmly and solely in one area of study, there\u2019s still a little room to tailor those \u201cunrelated\u201d requirements to round out, if not parallel, your preferred fields.",
                "Ali": "Professors don't usually know your name.  Although recently I got a high score on an exam and my professor gave me a present in front of the whole class.  It was fun but embarrassing too!  I don't really talk to other students unless I know them already so I don't know that much about people being competitive.  I hear they are assholes about things like that though, especially pre-meds.\r\n\r\nI don't know about most unique class but I took a really cool Viking history class with Jesse Byock.  That guy was way awesome and the class was cool too.  Vikings are just cool anyway I guess so it might be hard to mess that up.\r\n\r\nI went to office hours for my physics 6C professor all the time because he was hella helpful and I totally owned that class. I don't like to go to office hours normally- they are a lot better when there are other kids there.  I wouldn't want to just go in and ask a question by myself.",
                "Anthea": "As aforementioned, UCLA is a very, very large school. Frequently, you hear lectures in a auditorium with two hundred other people. You could probably go through your four years here with never having a professor call you by your first name. You may find that private attention from your instructors is wanting. However, if you put in the effort, it is not too difficult to form closer relationships with the professors. Classes usually get much smaller as you progress through your major, and as a junior or senior you will find ample opportunity to participate and discuss in class. Professors are also generally very nice; they like having you come to their office hours and will frequently extend it or will make special time for you to visit them. \r\n\r\nBut there are definite downsides to having such a large student body. Not getting individual attention pervades outside of the classroom; it is virtually impossible to get an appointment with an academic counselor come enrollment times, when you need them. \r\n\r\nAcademically, students are very competitive and care deeply about their studies, or at least I am, and so are many of my friends. I think I mentioned that some people sleep in the library -- this is definitely true, especially during Finals Week. I think UCLA fosters academic excellence; there are many opportunities for scholarships, or competitions (like essay competitions) and getting honors so you can shine. Being in the UCLA Honors program also comes with a few perks, one of which is priority enrollment, which comes in really handy.  There are definitely those who really don't care though, who never go to lecture (and magically show up in times for midterms or the final exam) -- so there is quite a spread.",
                "Rebecca": "Classes are often huge, so big, in fact, that sometimes it's impossible to get a seat. Professors rarely know names in big lecture halls, but going to office hours certainly helps. Professors teaching smaller classes tend to be more concerned with student learning and getting to know the people they are teaching. Office hours are a great way to increase your chance of getting to know the professor, and many professors are more than willing to make time to help with paper writing and other concerns. \r\n\r\nStudent studying often depends on the intensity of the major. South campus majors tend to study more, while north campusers wind up spending their time writing papers. Students tend to be very vocal regarding academics, and intellectual discussion, especially political, are extremely common. \r\n\r\nMy major, English, is relatively broad, as the requirements are quite flexible and they offer several different concentrations (Creative Writing, World LIterature, etc). Of course, I was also required to take general education requirements, which give insight into fields of study I might not otherwise pursue. UCLA gives a liberal arts education- most people will wind up needing a masters in order to move up in the workforce. UCLA seems concentrated on making students well rounded and interested in learning, but not necassarily preparing for the most technicaly jobs, as it is expected most will go to grad school.",
                "Addar": "Professors don't know your name.  \r\n\r\ndepends on the major.. some study every day, art majors never study. \r\n\r\nParticipation not common; no intellectual conversations.\r\n\r\nCompetition depends on the major, especially curved majors are very competitive."

                "Amy": "It is really hard to find a \"most\" popular one because student body here is huge and there are countless options in clubs and activities. But generally speaking, athletic activities and various parties are popular among most people. \r\n\r\nGreek life is not that valued here as it is in private universities. A lot of students are not at all interested. \r\n\r\nOn weekends, some people go home, some do the laundry and study, some hang out and have fun (there are good places to go in Westwood, Santa Monica, and downtown LA ), some just sleep. For example my roommate spends most of her weekends sleeping and the rest of time watching shows if she does not have homework to do. \r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned, I sometimes to to parties and club meetings.I spent most of my weekends studying and working in our most popular dinning hall on campus. I meet friends and talk to them by grabing meals and studying together. Because I love shopping and eating, I always try different stores and restaurants on and around campus.  ",
                "Peng": "The most popular activity is of course the great Beat SC bonfire rally, which is held annually on Wilson Plaza.",
                "Cynthia": "I would say that all the groups like USAC and GenRep that focus on representing the student body and organizing campus events are pretty popular and competitive to get into. I am involved with ICARUS Contemporary Dance Company which is the most low key dance group- we practice about 6 hours a week and have on campus performances as well as exhibitions at some dance competitions around the area. There a tons of dance groups, most of them are hip hop, which I don't do, hence the involvement with ICARUS haha. I was a member of Best Buddies (a club to integrate those with intellectual disabilities) last year and am now in Active Minds (a club dedicated to erasing the stigma of mental illnesses and promote mental health). \r\nAthletic events are pretty popular, and tailgating with a group is always fun. Football games are easy to get to without a car because of a bus service you pay for with the Den Pass (if you plan on going to more than 2 football games or basketballs games, GET THE DEN PASS! it's so worth it, and you get a free shirt!).\r\nNow, the party scene- thursdays are insane. not really in a good way... basically, frats have a \"quarterly\" (huge themed party) each quarter, and they always happen on thursdays. So there are usually multiple quaterlies on each thursday since there are 19 frats and only 10 weeks a quarter. if you have friends in the frat, it's a lot more fun, but otherwise, it's just a huge sweaty cramped mess and you usually have to pre-game since they hide their good alcohol, and you need to show an id to BUY alcohol from their bar. Any other night is usually kickbacks at frats or parties at apartments. So you need to know people. Thursdays, you can walk into any frat and hope for the best haha. \r\nIf parties aren't your scene, there are free movie nights at Ackerman grand ballroom or you can go into Westwood with some dorm friends and get Diddy Riese, or a restaurant, or shop. There is always something to do!",
                "Michelle": "There's so many student organizations/groups on campus that no one group really has the upper hand in popularity. Like I mentioned before, you find the group that interests you most and you make the best of your college experience and career. Student organizations span across a spectrum of choices, ranging from very academic to very social. It really all depends on what you're looking for, because you will definitely find it at UCLA. For example, there's a yo-yo club, several capella groups, pre-health clubs, tutoring clubs, campus events commission (planning large scale events for the entire student body), sustainability, community service, many religious groups, and the list goes on. There's a club/organization/group for about almost anything you can think of.",
                "Justin": "Although Greek life is not a huge percentage of the student body at large, it is a huge percentage of the white, upper middle class, suburban demographic, which itself is a minority.  Like I mentioned, every ethno-specific/national/religious group breaks off into fragments and the remainder (something like %20 or less) go Greek.  The Greek system here is really just a support system for the minority of students who haven't found an ethno-specific/cultural group to belong to.  Not trying to make them sounds like victims, but in this context they are a real minority, so... take from that what you will.",
                "Tanaya": "I love planning concerts with Hip Hop Congress, the committee I'm part of in the Cultural Affairs Commission office (which is part of USAC, the UCLA student government). We've brought T.I., Xibit, Living Legends, Ghostface, etc... It's a lot of fun and gives me the experience I need to get a job in PR! The Undie Run is amazing... it's on each Wednesday of Finals Week, and it was my first time doing it this past Wednesday... I had an amazing time, and I regret not doing it before! Thousands of UCLA students (most are drunk) run from Westwood to the Royce Quad in their underwear at midnight while doing the 8-clap and bashing on USC... it's an amazing time that makes you really feel like one with your campus!!",
                "Jason": "You asked me if fraternities and sororities are important here. Let me put it to you like this: if YOU think they are important, this is the school for you. \r\n\r\nBut there are also plenty of other diverse groups, almost anything you could want to immerse yourself in. And being in Los Angeles gives you access to nearly any activity that you can enjoy anywhere else.",
                "Matthew": "The most popular student groups on campus are ethnicity-based organizations, though many other groups exist revolving around sports, hobbies, and other competitive events.  I am involved with the rock climbing group on campus, and we don't do much other than frequent the rock wall at our fitness center!  Students usually leave their dorm rooms open, and the residence halls are very social and friendly.  My closest friends are a combination of high school friends and people I met on my dorm floor.  If I'm awake at 2am on a Tuesday, I'm probably playing poker with friends.  Fun traditions include the bonfire rally before the USC football game, and the Undie Run during finals week each quarter.  People party on a regular basis, with most parties revolving around the fraternity and sorority life.  I spend all of my weekends working, but there are plenty of things to do when around campus.  There is a whole city just off campus, with lots of food, entertainment, and stuff to do.",
                "Leah": "There are countless activities to do at UCLA.  The majority of campus is REALLY into sporting events.  Basketball and Football games are usually sold out.  There are also alot of music and theater performances, such as A Cappella festivals, choir concerts, and the UCLA Live season.  UCLA is also 10 minutes from the Geffen Playhouse, which houses many incredible productions.  \r\nUCLA has a really active social life as well.  Students often leave their doors open in the dorms, or hang out in the floor lounges so the majority of a first-year's friends live in their building.  Something that is unique to UCLA is that all of our dorms are on one hill, rather than spread out over the whole campus, so if you have a friend that doesn't live in your building, they are at maximum about 3 minutes away from you.  \r\nUCLA has a huge greek system, but its also very laid-back.  There is no pressure to join, and those who are in it are not considred more popular or less popular than those who aren't.  Like I said before, UCLA doesn't have cliques.  The greek system is incredibly fun though.  Our social calendars are constantly full, plus, we are very close to the sunset strip, an excellent place to hold off-campus events, such as formals or date parties.  It's a really great expereince.  \r\nPeople here party mostly on Thursday nights, but also on Fridays or Saturdays if the fraternities or sororities are having special events.  \r\nFor those who don't prefer to drink, Westwood has 7 movie theaters, not to mention the free sneaks and $2 movies on campus.",
                "Lindsay": "UCLA has a couple different kind of dorm arrangements.  In the standard dorms, the students very often form very close associations with their hall mates.  In some of the more secluded dorms, with a little more space for each room, the comradery doesn't really develop to the same extent.\r\n\r\nThere is always some kind of event going on on campus, including orchestra performances, dance recitals, theater, celebrity concerts, comedy shows - the list could go on and on.  Very often there are also free sneak previews of movies for the students.\r\n\r\nOne of the events that happens every quarter around finals time is the undie run where people run through campus with nothing but their underwear on - this is a time-honored tradition :p\r\n\r\nEvery year, UCLA is host to the Festival of Books where hundreds of book publishers come with their wares and thousands of people show up.\r\n\r\nFrats and sororities aren't really that big a deal here.  But they are the ones who pretty much have the parties.  If that's your kind of thing, then it's here for you.\r\n\r\nIf you're not interested in drinking, there's the movie theaters down in Westwood and the Santa Monica pier and promenade to explore.  \r\n\r\nAlso, if you are interested in video games, lots of people seem interested in them here.  At the moment, there is actually a worry about World of Warcraft and the amount of students actively participating in the game.",
                "Ryan": "My main involvment is with Theta Chi Fraternity, where I serve as the Executive Secretary. I feel that if you are coming in to UCLA not knowing anyone, the greek system is the best way to meet friends and build ever lasting commradary. There are always events going on on campus with the athletic events being the most popular because our teams excell. There are also campus traditions such as Spring Sing and undie Run which have been going on for years and are some of the most fun activities. The party scene seems to be prominent, especially at the fraternities. On any given Thursday or Friday, there are open parties there where people can dance and socialize and possibly meet people of the opposite sex. As long as you are with a group of friends, someone is bound to hear about an event going on.",
                "Russell": "Activities and social life are what you make them here.  You will have the opportunity to make 450 facebook friends in first quarter (I know someone who did!), go out and party, go to all your floor events, and never eat alone.  On the other hand, if that's not your style, you don't have to go out, and you won't be disturbed.\r\n\r\nI find myself somewhere in the middle.  I'm a pretty outgoing, social guy, but I do enjoy being alone sometimes.  My main method of being social is becoming involved in activities.  In fact, I fulfilled the goal I set for myself in high school (enterring college and getting involved in EVERYTHING) by joining chorale, Hillel, Kesher, Bruin Democrats, Scattertones A Cappella, floor government, ballroom dance, performing arts association, campus tours, and I forget what else.  It all proved a bit much, especially with 18 units of classes, so I scaled it back the next quarter, but the point is, I COULD have done all that stuff if I had been able to handle it in some other universe.\r\n\r\nFrat life doesn't disturb, but it's pretty active and easily accessible.  You don't have to drink to have fun with or in a frat.  You also don't have to drink to be cool.  I definitely didn't drink all of first quarter, and I still made friends and got involved in various communities easily.  It's easy to make connections and join clubs and groups.  There's an \"enormous club fair\" during the 1st week of the quarter where virtually every club/group gets a table on the field and students go around getting to know each other and signing up.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about UCLA activities and social life is the fact that it's not as hard as you think to distinguish yourself in such a big place; you just have to be you.",

                "Katherine": "The greek life looks to be fairly predominant here, but it's not the only way to be involved on campus. There are so many student groups - its crazy!!!",
                "Harper": "There are a lot of religious organizations, and a lot of frats and sororities, and they seemed to be fairly important. But if you're not into either of those, like me, you just have to find your people. Athetics are also really important, but you don't have to be a fanatic to enjoy your time at UCLA (also, like me). My advice to a freshman would be to join an organization that has to do with something you really like, and make friends in that organization, so that you have similar interests to your friends. A lot of people make the mistake of just partying as soon as they get to college, and they don't form solid friendships, because party people tend to be flaky. If you make solid friends first, partying will be way more fun.",

I came here as a theater student and had all my classes with the same 57 people for the entire first quarter, and for most of the other quarters for the rest of that year before I dropped the major. There are a lot of different theater opportunities on campus that actually put up shows a lot more often than one would expect.\r\n\r\nPeople party a lot. I think everyone thinks of any possible excuse to drink, even if its on a Wednesday at 11am. I don't really hang out with people on campus, most of the time I'm with friends that either graduated or didn't even go to UCLA.",

I met my closest friends in the dorms.  If I was awake on a Tuesday at 2AM, I was either putting together a paper I put off until the last minute, or hanging out with my friends doing all sorts of stupid stuff.  People 'party' pretty often.  But people don't just 'party' at school though, because since UCLA is in LA, people often go out to Hollywood and go to popular clubs in the area.",
                "Dan": "As far as social life is concernced, UCLA has nearly everything covered.  The dorm life for students is generally extremely close and many good friendships are developed early in the university career. Parties abound on Thursday nights, the unofficial party night for fraternities, and generally die off towards the weekend as many students from Southern California make their way home to do laundry or simply get home-cooked food.  Outside of the drinking scene, UCLA is ideally located to take advantage of LA's sporting events, Hollywood clubs and any other productions apparent in the city.  For those that cannot get around to everything in UCLA, the university also holds movie nights, theater screenings and a variety of other activities students can embrace if looking for activities to do.  The campus generates a great sense of community by students identifying themselves both as UCLA students and USC-haters.  The rivalry between USC and UCLA adds a unique element to interactions between groups in LA as almost everyone in LA following sports can be divided into one camp or the other.  Overall, the unity on campus is extremely high and just being from UCLA is enough to bring two students together.  Displays of campus unity are often seen and the campus generates a life of its own.  One such example is the \"undie run\" which occurs every wednesday of finals week (three times a  year) where students dressed only in their underwear run through campus at midnight for what amounts to massive party in the middle of UCLA's campus.",

                "Terry": "UCLA social life is great - there's something for everyone. Football and basketball games are always a hit, there are parties to go to nearly every night of the week.

Go shopping in Sanmo.",
                "Becky": "The students in the dorms leave their doors open depending on what type of dorm building you live in (like a residence hall vs. a suite) and depending on what people you live with; in other words, it really depends. All my closest friends came from my floor freshman year, and I made a bunch of new friends after I joined my a cappella group. The BEST events at UCLA are the USC/UCLA big game, Dance Marathon, Spring Sing, and UNDIE RUN!!! Off campus, there is TONS to do; you can take the big blue bus to santa monica (3rd street promenade), go to disneyland, go to hollywood, beverly hills...it's a really nice area. It definitely beats the ghetto that surounds USC. That's another thing we love to do: hate USC. It's easy to do.",
                "Emily": "Again social life is dependent on the individual student. For those who choose to stay in their room and watch TV, they will find UCLA's social scene extremely lacking. For those who wish to involve themselves there are endless opportunities. There are tons of groups, activities and events that take place on a regular basis.",

Football and basketball games are also very popular and FUN. The dorms are lively....if you're a freshmen and you live in a residence hall.

                "Jamie": "I play sports (football, volleyball and soccer) during my spare time. Video games are also really popular. \r\n\r\nMy closest friends are from my high school that go here, and friends i met through them, or people i live with. \r\n\r\nOn a saturday night i play video games, ping pong, board games.",
                "Diana": "I am involved with the Bruin Democrats. Its a great place to go to discuss and keep oneself updated and involved in what's happening politically; especially considering the rapidly approaching election.",
                "Toby": "If your'e not in the Greek system, good luck finding a social life. The big problem is, you have to be with people you like to enjoy a good social life, and good LUCK finding people worth liking. Oh, and as for Westwood, it's good for the occasional visit, but once you live there, you realize how little there is to do. The bus system can take you other, more interesting places around LA, and it's not terribly difficult to navigate, but it does take a long time to go anywhere on buses, so it's not very practical unless you block out whole days at a time.",
                "Adam": "Greek life is a big thing, but for the most part, kids get phased out of that scene by their 2nd year I find. There is a big apartment  party scene and I pretty much see the same people every weekend at these smaller, apartment parties. Athletic events are huge, especially bball and football and especially when we play SC. I hated dorm life but that it where I met my closest friends, and I was not very social in my dorm and got very tired of the experiene. I dont know much about the dating scene, random hookups seem the norm all over the world. The weekdays can be quite at night, as people are serious about studying, but my friends will randomly go out and party during the week. Welcome week is huge, espeically for freshman, and is accompanied by a big concert. Undie run is big, dance marathon, spring sing, but i havent participated in any of those. People party thursday-saturday night and parties get decreasingly more regular/crazy as midterms and finals sneak up. Last weekend I went to several parties, often a couple a night. I also went to a bar in westwood and visited some friends at USC and partied there. I have no idea what you could do on a saturday night that doesnt involve drinking-maybe a movie and dinner in westwood???? Off campus, i go to good LA restaraunts or bars or visit friends at other schools.",
                "Jerry": "Many students in dorms leave their door opens to talk to them. Athletic events are super fun and important at UCLA. There are usually guest speakers discussing world events and everything at UCLA. Theater is very prevalent at UCLA, because many events can be held at the gorgeous Royce Hall, UCLAlive events always happen there. The dating scene is very diverse - you have a lto to choose from. Traditions that happen every year are BEAT 'SC week, when we have the football game against USC and there are events all weekend to support our school and to show school pride. Depending on the group of people, people can party every other week or less, to many times a week, just depending on how heavy your courseload is. Fraternities and sororities aren't vital to college life, but they are fun to go to when you are looking for somewhere to go. Saturday nights don't have to be for drinking - many people are down to just play board games, watch movies, hang out in Santa Monica.",
                "Cody": "Christian groups, racial groups.  I think people group up too much based on that, it creates seperation outside of the classes.",
                "Danielle": "Group-wise, the school has too many to judge them by order of popularity.  Athletically, I\u2019d say the basketball following is the largest.  Within intramural and sports, Frisbee and softball have a pretty big following.  But Greek life is by far the biggest social \u201cclub\u201d on campus, as we\u2019ve got a very large number of fraternities and sororities, most of which are very large in and of themselves.  UCLA is one of the schools that originates the frat boy/sorority girl stereotypes\u2014it\u2019s usually not hard to pick out the Greek students in a crowd, but an equal number of people thinks that\u2019s a good thing and think it\u2019s a bad thing. \r\n\tIf you\u2019re not in a frat or sorority (first of all, don\u2019t worry, there are plenty), the next most likely source for friends and social groups is probably your neighbors, as the dorms are a pretty well-oiled social machine, in that everyone wants to get to know everyone.  As a rule the residences get more social as the quality of the building itself decreases, as the older returning students with priority usually have already established groups of friends (and are more than likely living with these people) and thus are less dependent upon their neighbors.  Freshmen seem to coagulate in the older dorms, trading a private bathroom for a social atmosphere which I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to call priceless.  Three years later, I live with friends from my freshman dorm, who have become my inseparable friends.  If you\u2019re in one of these predominantly freshman dorms\u2014which I would recommend\u2014you\u2019ll find doors open to eager neighbors just as excited to meet new people and try new experiences as you are. \r\nThere\u2019s also a big sports culture that comes out of IM and club sports, which are generally more relaxed and recreational than the varsity sports, and, in my opinion, a matchless source for a rewarding extracurricular and a group of extraordinary people.  I\u2019m a member of the Sailing Team, which is at once incredibly rewarding and enjoyable, and also a formidable experience in team-building and cooperation.  At the beginning of the year, every year, there\u2019s an Activities Fair, featuring every single club and group on campus with a booth, representative, and information.  I must emphasize\u2014it is overwhelming.  But it\u2019s also the best way to find some way to soak up your spare time with something more worthwhile than Facebook.  If you can\u2019t find something that interests you, you didn\u2019t look hard enough\u2014there are cultural clubs, volunteer organizations, intramural and club sports, and hobby groups.\r\n\tThe school is very self-sustaining, in that we\u2019re large enough to function like a small city, thus the students rarely need to go outside school to find something to do.  On-campus events, like sports games and movie screenings, become the main gatherings.  But even if you venture into Westwood, you\u2019ll find it very easy to connect with other students, because, like I said, the campus and immediate surroundings provide a very magnetic center for student life.  There are plenty of activities, whether organized by groups or by individual circles of friends, that don\u2019t require any drinking.  Simply exploring the town of Westwood is exciting by itself, as there are plenty of comedy clubs, theaters, restaurants, coffee shops, museums, etc, that allow students to go out and mingle outside of a party, and lots of those opportunities are free.  If you\u2019re interested in getting out of Westwood for a day or night, the Big Blue Bus of Santa Monica offers a student discount, so you can get to essentially the best parts of town for 25 cents.  \r\nWe also have a pretty well-developed sense of tradition.  Some highlights include the Beat \u2018SC Week (I think it\u2019s been changed officially to \u201cBlue and Gold Week\u201d for political correctness) and the culminating bonfire, which is a must for any sports fan.  In addition, on the Wednesday of every finals week, thousands of students gather for the \u201cUndie Run\u201d across campus, which is exactly what it sounds like, in an attempt (usually successful) to blow off the steam from the pressure that builds up at the end of the quarter.\r\n\tThe party scene, like many aspects of life here at UCLA, can take up as large or small a part of your life as you\u2019d like.  There\u2019s no overt pressure to \u201cgo out\u201d unless that\u2019s a feature of your social circle, because while there\u2019s no shortage of parties if you\u2019re looking for them, there are just as many people who stay in the dorms on a Thursday night (typically the busiest night in the frat party circuit) and watch movies in the common room or play group video games.  Again, it\u2019s one of the perks of such a large school\u2014regardless of your preference, there will be others who share it.",
                "Ali": "I guess some dumbass Korean Christian shit is pretty popular.. Maybe it's not.  There is a lot of that goin' down on Bruinwalk though.  I lived in sunset village when I was in dorms and that was pretty cool and I guess people left their doors bolted?  Not always and they weren't wide open.  But it was like a little community in B5 anyway so you could just knock and go hang out with someone.\r\n\r\nAthletic events are way popular and the people who attend them are broish and dumb as shit.\r\n\r\nDating scene?  I don't know about a SCENE.  Since when is dating a SCENE?  \r\n\r\nI met my closest friends in the dorms freshman year!\r\n\r\nDance marathon happens each year and I don't give a fuck about it.\r\n\r\nOh man how important are frats/sororities?  Really important.  Important in keeping sexism and inequality alive and healthy!  It's really miserable that people buy into that shit.  It really is a great way to encourage young men to think like date rapists (and act like them.. literally).  Also the sorority girls are just being taught \"their place\", and how to impose that place upon other women as well.  It makes me sick.\r\n\r\nIt's still the weekend... I was in Las Vegas!  Normally I don't drink on a saturday night though- I study/play video games/have a ton of hot sex (drunk sex is terrible)... you know.",
                "Anthea": "Social life in the dorms vary according to where you live. If you live in the Halls, you tend to have more contact with your fellow floor mates, as you are forced to shower with them, pee with them and have bowel movements with them on a daily basis. Yes, they must share public bathrooms. If you live in a suite, you get your own private bathroom, so such poignant experiences are regrettably not possible. \r\n\r\nMost of the time though, the doors in the Halls or the Suites are open, (the halls, more often than in the suites, mind you) and facilitate and welcome socialization. Many times, students just hang out in the corridors or the floor lounge, which is technically for studying, but turns more into a common room of sorts. Sometimes, one room on the floor is informally designated as the \"social room,\" possibly becuase of their T.V, xbox 360 elite, wii and playstation. Floors frequently go out on outings together (ours went to Pink's Hot Dog in Hollywood - I got the Ozzie Osbourne dog - it is amazing, you should try it with onion rings) or arrange other activities to do together; movie nights, karaoke nights and the like. Your sleeping schedule generally becomes extremely irregular during your stay at the dorms. People stay awake till dawn doing absolutely nothing, and becuase of this, you inevitably end up staying up till dawn doing absolutely nothing. It is rather hard to sleep when you hear other people chatting right outside your room eating pizza, and the walls are very thin. \r\n\r\nUCLA also invites many musicians, actors and speakers/comedians to come perform at Royce Hall, and students can obtain tickets to these events for a really good price. Ian McKellen came to play King Lear here, Tom Cruise came to speak, Joshua Bell came to play his violin as well as many others. Bill Clinton also came for a big event here, which was of course, open to all students. The students themselves also put on many really good performances. The Opera group once did Puccini's Gianni Schicchi and Suor Angelica which was thoroughly entertaining, even to my friends, who stated that \"opera is not my cup of tea.\"    \r\n\r\nOnce you leave the dorms though you must make your own social life happen and this can include more than getting drunk at a random apartment on a Thursday night. Like I mentioned before, there is plenty to do in LA, and you can go watch and Opera (I enjoy opera. Maybe you noticed?), go to the theatre and watch a musical (Wicked, is really good) or take a drive down the Sunset strip. Also one can go to Santa Monica during the weekends to go shopping or do hang out on the beach or the pier.",
                "Rebecca": "UCLA has a ton of clubs and organizations for students to join. Being politically active is quite popular, and even the Republican minority at UCLA is extremely visible. \r\n\r\nOne of the best things about UCLA is its ability to draw an amazing array of guest speakers and interest from people outside the UCLA community. UCLA students see a plethora of famous people, from movie stars, to politicians to authors come to campus and speak. Due to its location in Los Angeles, UCLA gets tons of free sneak peak movies, as well as the actual movie premiers in Westwood which provides a great oppurtunity for star watching as well as a chance to attend the premier. Perhaps one of the strangest things about UCLA is the celebrity presence- Adam Sandler plays basketball in our gym, how much closer can they get? \r\n\r\nThe highrise dorms at UCLA are perhaps the greatest way to meet a variety of people with interests of all kinds. 90% of my friends this year are friends I met on my floor as a freshman. The dorms do an amazing job of getting people involved, from floor government to karaoke parties to gingerbread house making, there is something for everyone. The dorms are a great place to bond with people just by sitting in their room and chatting, and many activities are just sit back and relax. Nintendo is a favorite pastime of my friends, as well as board games and beer pong. \r\n\r\nGreek life is only important if you want it to be important. While i chose not to join a sorority, I still attend frat parties at my leisure. Dating is not impossibly if you're not into the Greek life, in fact, most people tend to meet significant others through their friends! Dating doesn\u2019t usually happen per se, rather just general hanging out, with the occasional date for a special occasions. There are tons of on campus activities that couples can do together (such as go to an Ackerman $2 movie). \r\n\r\nWeekends are filled with anything from going to beach, going shopping in Santa Monica, or just going to the On-Campus Sunset Recreation center to swim or play some volleyball. At night, a trip to get cookies from Diddy Reise in Westwood or playing Pictionary is the perfect way to hang out after a rough week. UCLA has tons of on-campus theatre production, both student run and professional. Additionally, museums, such as the Fowler or the Getty are great afternoon places to check out.",

Undergrads are popular with grad students.\r\n\r\nClosest Friends: proximity is everything, especially first year.  The Greek scene is good for meeting a lot of people.

Additionally, being a science major, your first year classes are lecture halls (200-400 students a class!). It was very overwhelming and stressful because I had to learn to develop new study skills, accepting the fact that professors will not know your name by the end of the quarter, and adjust to living in the dorms. The big classes were a turn-off for me and so was walking down the hill every morning to go to class. However, it was something that I got used to and it doesn't bother me anymore.\r\n\r\nI always thought UCLA was an intelligent bubble--you literally live where you go to school and everyone is very smart, which can be discouraging sometimes because I feel that I had to work extra extra extra hard just to meet the standards. Again, this is something that you get used to and learn to grow from. You definitely have to work harder here than at most other universities, because mostly everyone that got accepted here were in the top of their high school classes. My progress here has dramatically improved since freshman year and I'm much better at staying on top of my priorities and academic workload.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely a lot of UCLA school pride here! Especially around the time when the football team plays against USC (our school rival). There's occasional student protests, mainly over tuition increases (as far as I've noticed), and many other events happening on campus ALL THE TIME. Living in the dorms can be a hit or miss. My experience of living in the dorms has been phenomenal! It was the first place where I made my first friends (and our friendship has grown since then!). I definitely recommend living in the dorms the first two years of college; it really gives you a chance to meet many other students the same age (and many of them will happen to be taking the same classes too). ",
                "Justin": "In a way UCLA has it all; Great intellectuals, obnoxious student politics, major NCAA sports teams, gorgeous neo-renaissance buildings surrounded by trees and hills, and top programs in the the arts and sciences.",
                "Tanaya": "I think that the best thing about UCLA is that it's so versatile in terms of the students, talents, and quality programs offered... we have a great academic program, no matter what major you choose, and we also have a diverse range of student groups to suit everyone's needs. Although people say that UCLA is too huge and impersonal, I like that about it for the most part... it's not really as impersonal as it's made out to be, and I love the fact that even on your last day before you graduate, you have many more people to meet and become friends with. Westwood is our college town, and although parking is a huge hassle, it's an amazing place... we have big chain stores as well as many one-of-a-kind mom-and-pop places to enjoy that make Westwood unlike any other place you'll ever experience! The movie premieres are also awesome... There's a lot of school pride, especially when we have a game against 'SC or we're making a title run of any sort. The Undie Run is my most memorable experience, and so is Bruin Bash and all the concerts that I help to organize as part of USAC's Cultural Affairs Commission! I got to meet a lot of musical artists, and I'll never forget that experience!",
                "Jason": "The academics here are great. But the students here are spoiled little brats that are largely propelled into these positions by their class. The ones that do merit being here, came for the wrong reasons. Not enough students anywhere go to college to learn. Many come to get a good job, many come to figure out what they want to do, but most come \"because it's like, what you like do after high school. You like, go to college.\" Westwood is definitely a college town, and if I had 15 dollars to buy a panini I'd be able to enjoy the little shops and cafes here. But I don't, so keep that in mind too. The students haven't grown out of high school - they flock in groups to go anywhere. You often see students panicking about whether they will be able to eat a meal because they have not yet found somebody to go with them to a dining hall. If you are an insecure worm, you will be at home. Otherwise you'll range between amused and annoyed on a daily basis.",
                "Matthew": "The best thing at UCLA is the positive environment emanating from the students, faculty, and campus itself.  Everyone loves being at UCLA, whether they teach, work, or learn there.  The school has an interesting history and we have lots of pride in our school.  The campus is huge, as is the size of the student body, and size of classes.  People love UCLA, whether they go there are not.  I am so happy to go to this school!",
                "Leah": "UCLA is perfect.  Its a small campus (area-wise) with a big campus feel.  It has the perfect location, nestled between the 3 B's (Beverly Hills, Bel-Air, and Brentwood).  We are the most widely recognized university in the nation and we get the most applications every year.  When I tell people I go to UCLA, everyone is impressed, because not only is UCLA a dream school, it is also one of the top schools in the nation, recently labelled one of the \"new ivies\".  \r\nThe campus has everything you could ask for:  shady hills to sleep or study on, beautiful buildings, numerous libraries, all the food chains you could imagine (except mcdonalds), and the second best dorm food in the nation (to a culinary school). We also have the largest student union in the nation, including our own apple store, shoe store, market, bookstore, and clothing store. On campus, there are countless places to hang out, but the favorite seems to be Kerckhoff Coffee House, home of amazing coffee and the highest grossing Baskin Robbins in the nation.  However, alot of people like to go out of UCLA to really hang out.  \r\nAnother thing that makes UCLA unique and even more perfect is Westwood.  Westwood is the ideal college town: 10 minute walk from campus, home of pinkberry, snowberry, Bj's, noodle planet, enzo's, cpk, the greek store (for all our sorority & fraternity needs), victoria's secret, bebe, chili's, cvs, and the all important diddy riese (home of the $1.25 ice cream sandwiches!).  Besides all that, it is also a safe town (which is why all the USC kids drive all the way across LA to come hang out there...seriously).\r\nOne of the things about UCLA that makes it so fun is the amount of school pride.  A day never goes by where at least a quarter of the campus isn't wearing UCLA attire or colors.  We have so many spirit events, especially before our big game against USC in the fall.  Having so much spirit really unites the campus and makes it one big blue & gold experience.",
                "Lindsay": "UCLA is a very prestigious school, both here and abroad.  I feel that it is one of the few universities that you can mention in another part of the world, and people will know what you are talking about.  When people from my area find out that I go to UCLA, they are usually pretty impressed.  \r\n\r\nThe campus is pretty large, depending on how quickly you like to get around it can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to get from one side of campus to another, but there is lots of great architecture and even a sculpture garden to make the walks more enjoyable.  Things are a lot more relaxed on North Campus, where the social sciences and humanities are.  South Campus is the territory of all of the competitive pre-med science majors.  Being a double major in sociology and psychology, I have spent some time in both sides of campus, but the university also encourages well-roundedness in your studies and meeting people with different educational interests through the general education courses you take here.  \r\n\r\nUCLA is located in Westwood - it's almost like UCLA's own little town, with four one-screen movie theaters, dozens of restaurants, and some stores like bebe and Anne Taylor.  It's a pretty relaxed atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nUCLA shares a rivalry with USC and during football season, you can see the school spirit.  Although football has never been my thing, it's still fun to have some competition with the other \"neighborhood\" university.  This has resulted in all kinds of pranks between the two, such as when USC poured red-dyed laundry detergent in one of our fountains that ended up flooded Franz Hall, our psychology building.",
                "Ryan": "I feel UCLA is one of the top ranking schools in the country and the opportunities for success that are offered here is immense. Although we have a large student body, it does not conflict in anyway with the daily activites of being a student. I feel UCLA has built a repuation for itself as one of the west coast \"Ivy League\" schools and it feels great to tell people that you go here. It makes them feel that you are ranked among the top prosects in the country. UCLA is definetly a college town because Westwood is host to an immense amount of student attractions and events. There is never a dull moment in this area! In my opinion, this school has immense school pride considering we are also one of the elite athletic schools. Our rivalry with USC is second to none. The administration and faculty here are excellent and each class leaves you with a much broader sense of the world. Overall, I feel UCLA gives everyone an equal opportunity to achieve high goals and at the same time provides the student with a thrilling and adventerous journey.",
                "Russell": "People get worried about such a big school.  I certainly was.  The truth is, UCLA is its own city.  I came from a small high school where everyone knew each other, the teachers were personable and friendly, and spirit was kept on the DL.  At UCLA, I have had a very different experience, and I couldn't be more grateful.\r\n\r\nCollege is supposed to bridge a gap between one world and another.  Being in a big place allows you to find communities and use your own resources.  Probably the main difference between the pre college and world and the post college world is that no one hands a lollipop in real life.  At UCLA, I've been able to go out and find my own lollipop in a safe, encouraging environment.  The school seems smaller than it is when you be yourself and go out and DO yourself...if that makes sense :)\r\n\r\nHonestly, UCLA has no weaknesses.  Yes, here we go, another Bruin who likes to brag and say NOTHING bad about his school.  The truth is, the only complaint that continues to poke my side is parking.  Parking at UCLA blows.  It's like trying to talk to Buddha about the quadratic formula; your needs simply won't be addressed.  Other than that, UCLA caters to all.  Bruin plaza has been host to experiences I'll never forget, like a mock wedding for a gay couple (just months before the California Supreme Court legalized it!!!), a mindblowing birthday party for Israel, a performance by someone who, in my mind is the next Marvin Gaye, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you mass thousands of people who are smarter than you who then devote their every day to helping you experience something bigger than yourself, you will get my school.",
                "Lorie": "UCLA is a bubble environment within LA, but it's my bubble and i love it.  it's got a big administration and it can be easy to get lost.  they hype up the honors department, but the honors counselors are awful.  if you need academic advice, go to your departmental counselor - the english one, at least, is great.  \r\n\r\nliving on the hill is a lot of fun, there is always something to do.  for freshman i'd recommend the basic residence hall dorms, because it's easier to get to know people.  suites can be a little more isolated, but they're fine for second year when you've established a social circle.\r\n\r\nthe dining halls are amazing.  the restaurants aren't as wonderful, but they're still extremely convenient - during rush hour they can take forever though, so if you want breakfast before class, be sure to go early.",
                "Tate": "Looking back at UCLA, I don't think I would change anything about the school itself.  I spent most of my time at Kerkhoff Hall because that's where our television station was located as well as the school paper, student government, and other school organizations.  That's the 'working hub' of the school, you're likely to always find people doing something there anytime day or night.  The biggest recent controversy that I can think of is the tasering incident last year.  There is a lot of school pride, especially during the annual \"Beat SC Week\" on campus, which is the lead up to the big football game with USC.",
                "Katherine": "Of course, at the mere mention of UCLA, I can impress many people, but thats not why I chose to go there. It's a great location in terms of centrality in the Los Angeles area. I'm a local, so I can accurately say that anything worth visiting in LA is of decent distance to the campus. The neighborhood is lovely, though the homeless population seems to be slowly creeping up - sometimes the homeless hang out on campus and that can be some what of a nuisance. Students on campus have an enormous amount of pride - my boyfriend, who isn't a student at UCLA, once noted how many people were wearing or carrying some sort of UCLA gear. The campus is laid out on a hill, so the trek often involves some sort of climb, but its a great workout! The campus is beautiful though and often, on a sunny day, I find myself sitting down outside Royce and taking in the views. Another minor bother are the large amount of outside groups on campus; from the campus tours for prospective students to the various field trips for local students ranging from pre-school to high school, the campus is almost constantly full of wanderers and revelers.",
                "Harper": "UCLA is a fairly prestigious school, on the West Coast anyway, so I generally get very good reactions when I tell people I go to UCLA. And, for the most part, it lives up to its potential. But, because it is so big, and it's public, there is a lot of bureaucracy to deal with on a regular basis. They make it very difficult to do anything \"official\".\r\nUCLA is essentially a bubble filled with other little bubbles. When you live there and go there ful time, you get the impression that nothing else exists. Then, when you start to find a group to fit into (like jocks, or theater people), you start to feel like only that exists. Then, even though it's such a big school, it starts to feel like a little town where everyone knows each other.",
                "Yvette": "the best thing about UCLA are the resources and the fact that if there is anything you want to know, you can learn about it here. here i feel like the world is at my fingertips, the sky is literally the limit. i would change the kind of uppity us and them thing that there is going on here, people don't really like to acknowledge it much less talk about it. minority students are marginalized by the other students, and also people here aren't very friendly. i think its a bit too large, everything they say about UCLA being impersonal and huge is true no matter what anyone says, you really have to find some good friends and stick together and make your own community. when i tell people i go to UCLA they are excited and they want to ask me all about it, its flattering. when i'm on campus i spend a lot of time in the cafes in between classes, the food here is good! Westwood is completely dominated by UCLA, i think its endearing, as students we get a lot of respect around town. there is A LOT of school pride, we here are very big on our sports teams, and i think pretty much everyone  sports a UCLA T-shirt or sweatshirt, i know i do. i think a big complaint is the walking distance, i live in the dorms and it takes me a good 20 mins to get to class every morning, and the walk back is all uphill!",
                "Sarah": "The campus is really great and has a ton of resources for students. Westwood is kind of a college town, but is usually frequented by middle school and high school students as well, so it isn't really an exclusive college town.  At the same time, it's right in the middle of Los Angeles, which is basically the best place in the world.",
                "Joseph": "wow, thats a lot of questions...ok, here it goes. UCLA has one of the largest work hard, play hard populations I've ever seen. The average GPA of men in fraternities is higher than the all men's average on campus, which is a testement to the students ability to balance work and play. If I could change one thing I would want Greek Life to get more involved with positive community portrayal and public relations. I want people who have never thought of going Greek to go Greek and those that don't to appreciate the work that fraternities and sororities do for the UCLA and Los Angeles communities.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a comment about the size of UCLA, there are 40,000 plus undergraduates but you normally dont have a problem seeing people you know around campus.\r\n\r\nWhen you tell people you're going to UCLA most people are impressed and happy for you. Some people look down on it as a public school and those that go to Ivy Leagues might feel it's a little beneath them, but when they're stuck studying 24/7 and no one knows how to have fun at their campus they better not complain to me.\r\n\r\nAs a freshman and sophomore most of my time was spent in the dorms or in class. I would study in the study lounges on the floor that my dorm was and I would attend parties and whatnot either in the fraternity house or dorm rooms. Junior year comes with upper division classes that are both challenging and inpirational. I spend a lot more of my time in the library now because I finally found that I study better their without distractions. The academic side of campus is split into \"north campus\" and \"south campus\". As a science major most of my classes are in \"south campus\" where as the humanities and all the BA students can have their precious \"north campus\".\r\n\r\nWestwood is an AMAZING little college town. If you have a car and can afford the parking, bring it, because LA, Hollywood, and Santa Monica are just a short car ride away. If you don't have a car or don't want to spend an hour looking for parking, don't worry at all. Everything in Westwood, from the super market, to the starbucks, to the bars, and Chipotle is all walking distance. Also, unless you really want super cheap rent, most of the apartments and all of the fraternity houses are just off campus and all within a 10 min. walk which means you never need a DD and you never need to worry about driving under the influence (not that anyone does that) The town is super safe (although there are quite a lot of bums) and UCPD is very college student friendly (so as long as you're not carrying an open container or throwing up in the street they wont bother you).\r\n\r\nThe councelors at UCLA are phenomenal. Meet with one soon and often to sort out any problems you need. There are a lot of students though, so just be patient and courtious and they will work wonders for you. I don't know much about the rest of the adminstration.\r\n\r\nBiggest recent controversy on campus was probably the tazering incident in our library. You can probably find it on youtube.com\r\n\r\nUCLA has tons of school pride. I think the very best evidence of this are the UCLA basketball games. We have a section called \"The Den\". To get into these floor level seats you need to camp out from the day before the game and stay throughout the night to get your seat saved. You also MUST wear a blue den shirt or a UCLA baketball jersey. For the UCLA vs USC basketball game you usually need to camp out two nights in a row. This section is one of the most exciting and loud fan sections in college sports.\r\n\r\nI will always remember my sophomore year, Fall of 2006, when UCLA upset #2 or 3 USC at our home field, the Rosebowl. We had played like crap all year and the USC game is our biggest rivalry. They had beaten us about 9 years in a row (before that streak started UCLA had beaten them about 9/10 years in a row)and were shooting to make it 10. They needed to win to go to the national championship. We played AMAZING defence and upset the lowly Trojans 13-9. We tried storming the field because it was absolutely amazing, but we don't own the Rosebowl, we rent it, and they had crowd control police with tear gas stopping us from charging the field. I will always remember that.\r\n\r\nThe people that complain the most often are ones that usually don't get out enough. Some people get into UCLA just because they work hard, not neccessarily because they are really intelligent and they need to stay in and work harder than most students. They often complain that the course load is intense (which it is, we have to learn a class in 10 weeks compared to the 15 of semester schools) and they don't have enough time in the week.",
                "Dan": "UCLA is a campus that offers its students almost everything.  UCLA has arguably the nation's best athletic program, an idyllic campus located in Westwood in Southern California, beautiful weather, prestigious academics and a vibrant campus community that looks after both current and future needs of students and alumni.  Due to the large student population, groups can be found for almost every niche from cement-canoe engineering projects to club sports.  The community on campus is enchanced by a relatively compact campus (it is the smallest of the UC system) and localized residential area that allows friendships to be nurtured seemlessly. The dining-hall food is particularly spectacular, often rumored to be rated the best in the nation, and based on personal experience, is much better than any other college food sampled including all rival UC schools.  The only thing UCLA does not provide is relief from the traffic in the surrounding LA area which is particularly frustrating but rarely encountered as most students have all they need in Westwood.  UCLA offers a little of everything and for the outgoing student it is a treasure-trove of options that can all be explored but might be intimidating for those less-inclined to take initiative themselves.  At times dealing with such a large university can be confusing and daunting, but the campus has many programs  in place to aid the overwhelmed student.",
                "Andrea": "Our school is huge, but after a year or so, it seems so much smaller. You'd be surprised how often you run into people you know, or how connected everyone is, but at the same time there are always new people to meet. I would consider this one of the best things about UCLA. Plus we have Westwood Village, the perfect place for food, drinks, shopping, and whatever else you need.",
                "Terry": "There are a ton of great opportunities associated with being in LA - movie previews, big-time speakers, anything you want, if you're willing to commit to it. I think the big size is great, it provides you with countless options with regards to academic, social, and personal life.",
                "Charlie": "I love the diversity, and the many opportinities that's availiable to students.",
                "Becky": "UCLA is the perfect size, because while there are almost 30,000 undergrads, you find communities in dorms and in student groups that make the campus feel smaller. But it's more exciting to be surrounded by tons of people. Westwood is a good college town, with Bebe, American Apparel, Victoria's Secret, etc. and plenty of good places to eat.",
                "Emily": "The best think about UCLA is the diversity. There is something for everyone and the balance between academics and fun is just right. THe one thing that bothers me is that sometimes it is difficult to find helpful counselors when you need help. It seems that even when you take the time to search out help, the people you meet with know even less than you do. I have definitely had to learn how to rely on my own resources and those of my peers because of the lack of  help from UCLA counselors. When I tell people I attend UCLA it is with a sense of pride and it is obvious that many are impressed by my academic accomplishments. I work at the coffee house on campus and this is where I have found a home away from home/dorm room and I love it.",

I'll never forget when I went up to Stanford my Freshman year and watched the UCLA football team win in overtime.",
                "antonio": "Why is it that engineers struggle to get out of school in 5 years, having to take 4 classes each quarter to get out in 4 years...but other majors can get away with taking 3 classes a quarter, take extra random classes, and manage to get out in 3-4 years? I have so many friends graduating in the next two years, and it just doesn't make any sense that I won't be able to walk with them for graduation.",
                "Tom": "UCLA IS AWESOME! everything about it breathes excellence from academics to athletics to extracurriculars; just about anything you can think of. Coupled with the fact that it is in Westwood Village surrounded by Bel-Air and Beverly Hill and minutes away from the beach and mountains put it in an ideal location. YES Mountains, even from my dorm room I can see snow covered peaks on the outskirts of LA.",
                "Bob ": "The school is just right. I came to this school to get the big school feeling - to sit in the lecture hall with 400+ students, to be lost out in the crowd, yet at the same time to stand out in the crowd. It's a unique feeling and as with all large academic institutions there are TONS of complaints with overcrowding or enrollment. Personal philosophy: if you're going to whine about it, you better have an alternative or better yet, just leave; no one's making you stay. UCLA is an amazing place.",
                "Alex": "UCLA has everything to offer, so people who arent decided on what they want to pursue can look into a wide array of activities, from cultural organizations to volunteer projects to all sorts of different shit that i ended up never looking into myself. the walk to class isnt great but its good exercise, and you get to see your friends and stuff. the school is very vast but it isnt deathly, the walks can be long but the view is always nice since the building architecture is pretty ornate. being able to say you go to ucla has its perks, it has a great rep it seems, and always ranks in those top 25 universities things that us news does like once a year, also i heard that ucla was ranked the most recognizable university in the world. ucla has a bunch of places where a lot of stuff occurs, of course the hill which is where all the on campus housing is, where there are a lot of events, but also places like ackerman student union which is like the heart of campus, wooden center gym, pauley pavilion gym, etc. westwood has a lot of good food spots also, and some good study spots also, and you can also spot celebs once in a while. there is a lot of school pride it seems, people who go here are generally very proud of it. if there is one thing ill remember about ucla its the wide array of different people i met while here, way bigger and broader of a range than in high school where everyone is from the same community and most of your friends do similar activities as yourself.",
                "Jamie": "The weather is great. People seem impressed when I tell them I attend UCLA. \r\n\r\nMost of my time on campus is spent in class or in the computer lab. The computer lab is an excellent resource and has programs to use in my classes, as well as internet access.",
                "Diana": "I like the fact that there are so many things to do at UCLA. Whether its a Monday, or Friday night, if you're looking to procrastinate, you will always be sucessful. The school is extremely large, and it does take some skill to maneauver through the beaurocracy sucessfully. If you are motivated, it is equally as easy to join a club and create a smaller and more intimate community for yourself that will make the school seem much less huge.",
                "Toby": "UCLA is one gigantic competition. If you thought it was competitive to get INTO UCLA, just wait till you get there and try to survive. You may ask, \"Well, isn't that just life? Isn't one always having to prove oneself to get ahead?\" To that I will say yes and no, you argumentative douchebag. Yes, it is important that one uses the college experience to learn how to present oneself in the best way possible, so as to make the best impressions in all situations. However, it is unnecessary and downright tiring to be constantly forced to prove your worth to satisfy people you know to be not worth your time anyway.",
                "Adam": "The best thing about UCLA is the diversity and the academics. Next quarter I'm taking a class with General Wesley Clark!!! How col is that??? UCLA is HUUUUUGE, but thats a good thing and bad thing. It might take you a while (maybe a whole year or 2) to find out what you are into, or find some friends, or discover good professors, but once you do, UCLA is a great place. When I tell people I go to UCLA the usual response usually has to do with Asians and the difficulty of the school and people assume I'm smart. If I am stuck on campus, I usually spend my time at 1 or the numerous north campus coffee houses. They are relaxed, play nice music, and I always run into a friendly face. There are south campus spots too, but since my major is north campus, i dont go south. South is also relatively ugly compared to N. campus. Westwood isnt really a college town. It is really expensive and the bar, late night scene isnt so bumping. The biggest \"scene\", I guess is the nook of apartments around UCLA or the dorms. I guess frats are a thing too, but not my thing. I have no opinion of administration, except that getting classes is a bitch the first 2 years and there is always a lot of red-tape if you need to do something. BY FAR, the biggest controversy was the tazering incident last year. There is a ton of school pride, especially whenever UCLA plays USC...the entire campus gets really into it and there are decorations and you basicaly cant hide from it. Its difficult to pin down one experience, but I have had certain professors an classes that will stick with me forever. Also, freshman year welcome week was a blast.

                "Jerry": "The best thing about UCLA is the love you will develop as you make your way through college. One thing I'd change: parking! Even though the school is pretty large, since it's a public school, you get to meet the people you want to meet, and you're not constantly bumping into people. People are proud that I go to UCLA, and think it's a big achievement. I spend most of my time in classes, in a computer lab, or at the library when I'm on campus. We have an awesome college town - we're right next to Westwood Village, which is a wonderful array of stores and restaurants that students can go and enjoy. UCLA's administration helps - I'm in a separate school (school of engineering) so they are very specific in helping you out. The biggest recent controversy on campus was probably last year with the tasering situation in the library. There is SO much school pride at UCLA, it's outrageous. No one on the west coast can beat what we have. There are a lot of traditions here at UCLA that everyone takes a part of, but nothing unusual. Experiences I will always remember is being at the USC v. UCLA football game and when we beat them 13-9. THe most frequent student complaints are that classes fill up fast when you want them the most.",
                "Cody": "I would want  more people i can relate to.  People are impressed when they hear I go hear sometimes",
                "Danielle": "Not to sound so general, but the best thing about UCLA really is that it\u2019s so well-rounded.  I would challenge you to find another school that features such a high concentration of academics, athletics, social life, and networking.  The size of the school is actually a huge advantage; more students means more interests, and it\u2019s guaranteed that every individual will find students with similar goals.  Once you realize that size translates to diversity, it\u2019s very easy to make the school feel as small or large as you\u2019d like, as we\u2019re large enough to offer resources to support the smallest groups.  If pressed, I\u2019d change the distance between the apartments and classes, because to get from one end of campus to the other requires a good 25 minutes, which can be a pain if you\u2019re running late.  Something I didn\u2019t realize until getting here was the reputation that the name \u201cUCLA\u201d carries; it\u2019s very impressive without being unapproachable.  \r\n\tHonestly, the only thing I find myself complaining about is the length of time it takes to walk to campus, as it\u2019s so large, and the residential part of campus is really separate from the classrooms.  But, I\u2019ll also be honest, the 20 minute brisk walk also often serves as my excuse for exercise.\r\n\tA major selling point is the area\u2014as it should be.  Westwood sets the bar high for \u201ccollege town\u201d, with shops and restaurants catering (sometimes literally) to the collegiate lifestyle, both in their prices and hours.  It\u2019s a convenient and comfortable town that adds to the \u201chome\u201d feeling of campus by eliminating the pressing need for a car and creating an environment outside of the immediate campus that students can still feel connected to.  Every UCLA student feels a sense of ownership over Westwood, relying upon it as much as it relies upon us.\r\n\tThe campus itself boasts an impressive set of buildings and common areas, and the sort of brick and ivy ambience that I think a lot of West Coast schools lack.  I like that there\u2019s enough of a variety of spaces to spend time in, like coffee shops if you enjoy noise and company, or quiet lawns if you like peace and quiet.  You never quite feel as if you\u2019re on your own, though, which is a comfort to me although it might be an oddity for some.  Thankfully the weather not only accommodates but encourages me to spend gaps in my schedule outside, on a bench or a lawn catching up on some reading or napping.  It\u2019s not uncommon for students on campus to feel very at home, comfortable enough to fall asleep in such a public place\u2014is it the anonymity afforded by such a common-minded but large public?\r\nI\u2019ve never experienced any problems personally with the administration, but if there\u2019s any area in which the size of the school might get in the way it would be the bureaucracy.  Like any formidable administration, though, it\u2019s just a matter of doing a little research ahead of time and making appointments with those you need to reach.\r\n\r\n\tUndoubtedly the largest recent controversy was the Taser Incident.  (A student was tasered in the library, by campus police, after refusing to cooperate, and the event was caught by a student cameraphone, causing an outbreak of debate over police brutality and student rights).  I think the biggest problem resulted from the flood of gossip that prevented many of the students from getting a clear picture of what actually happened.  I was fascinated, if not extremely surprised, though, by how quickly a spectrum of opinion appeared\u2014and on Facebook, of all places.  I saw a flood of groups formed to discuss the incident, half of which supported the actions of the police and half of which called for their reprimand.  Personally I found myself torn; I do like to know that the campus police take security seriously in a city where crime and danger can be pervasive stereotypes, but the response seemed alarmingly disproportionate, and that kind of display was a sobering reminder that campus police are, in fact, regular police, and not necessarily there to accommodate student comforts.\r\n\tUndoubtedly the majority of school pride stems from our athletic program, and feeds off our crosstown rivalry with USC, but such pride and rivalry can only thrive in a place where there\u2019s more to be proud of than simply sports.  I\u2019m extremely proud of our basketball team and it\u2019s reputation, to be sure, but I\u2019m also proud\u2014and I feel my fellow students are too\u2014of other equally impressive things that make up the blue and gold, like our campus, our library, our band, our school paper, and above all our academic reputation.  Again, it\u2019s all about our well-roundedness; there\u2019s something at UCLA for everyone to be proud of, not just the all-star athletes.  Our school pride goes beyond most.  \r\n\r\n\tThe most unusual thing about UCLA is its versatility, resulting directly from our size, because there\u2019s no single point about the school that stands out from the rest enough to define us.  We don\u2019t necessarily specialize in anything, because we seem to specialize in everything\u2014which makes UCLA a better place for the student who isn\u2019t done exploring yet.  There are plenty of places you can go if you\u2019ve got a specific interest, places that cater directly and singularly to those interests, but there aren\u2019t many other places you can go to explore everything.    Because of this diversity, I think the right people end up here, i.e. the ones who haven\u2019t made up their minds yet and want a place to do it.  Many students come here because UCLA allows for such a wide spectrum of possibility, and we come here with very open minds, which are difficult things to disappoint.  \r\n\tI do hear a lot of complaints about the enrollment process, and the difficulty of planning a schedule or getting into specific classes.  Unfortunately, this is one of the drawback to a school of our size; space can be limited.  But this can usually be avoided by some planning and foresight, such as designing multiple possible schedules and perhaps simply emailing a professor\u2014they are very good about responding, and usually very quickly\u2014with questions about enrollment capacity or waitlists.",
                "Ali": "The worst thing is how big it is- like not necessarily the size, but how the school doesn't care about you individually.  You get stuck in a ton of red tape and bureaucratic runarounds to do anything and no one remembers you or cares.\r\n\r\nI really like going to school here anyway because I like my classes and I have met a lot of people I really like.  There are a ton of people I totally hate like all the assholish sorority/frat people bein' gay all over the place.  I guess that's ok though because we can make fun of how dooshy they are.  We are a lot cooler than them.  Also there aren't a huge amount of fat people here which is great.  Well there are a lot of fat sorority pieces of shit but hey, what are you going to do?",
                "Anthea": "UCLA, is well, in Southern California. We enjoy great weather (which seems really important to most of the students here, who are extremely sensitive to clouds or rain) and a lovely campus with plenty of bright green grass and large trees. UCLA is also located in LA - so there is always plenty to do - if you make the effort. If you like stalking stars, they are reportedly seen at the Whole Foods Market, or the Starbucks, or you can always attend a movie premiere because many are held right here in Westwood. There are always movies to go watch, whether you enjoy the mainstream or the obscure. There are plenty of restaurants to try out and bars/clubs to go to. Hollywood is not that far away, and neither is Universal Studios. Driving around to get to these places is one of the biggest problems though. Parking spots are expensive (and so is gas) and the traffic can be atrocious.   \r\n\r\nUCLA is huge. It is the most applied to school in the United States, and as a consequence, you tend to end up being your 9-digit student ID number. In addition, instead of mingling, the students tend to fall into smaller cliques or join student groups (more often than not arranged by racial background) so there's not much interaction. Moreover, the campus is geographically divided into South and North campuses, which also creates bubbles and does not make mingling easy.\r\n\r\nUCLA students generally have a lot of school pride. We like to support out phenomenal basketball team and go to sporting events with a blue wig on, or apply blue and yellow paint to our bodies to show school spirit. We also like to remind everyone that we're the first establishment to have 100 NCAA titles and celebrate it at every basketball and football game. Others, who don't care for athletics much, show their school pride by boasting about UCLA academics, which is less subtle but no less effective (my roommate does this).",
                "Rebecca": "UCLA has so much to offer simply because of its sheer size, and there are endless oppurtunities no matter what your interests are. Of course, classes are also huge, which can also be a disadvantage, and oftentimes professors seem only interested in their research, and not in teaching. \r\n\r\nUCLA has a big name- both in the US and across the world. Los Angeles is a great city, and Westwood offers a nice area of movies, restaurants and of course, Diddy!\r\n\r\nUCLA has an amazing athletic program, and students are more than proud to be able to say that they are a Bruin. Support at football and games are amazing, and students show their pride by wearing school colors and sporting \"BEAT SC\" tattoos, among other things.\r\n\r\nUCLA has tons of traditions and I'm proud to participate in them each year. The rally and bonfire for the USC game, undie run, and Blue and Gold week are just a few of my favorite memories and things I look forward to every time they come around. \r\n\r\nSomething interesting about UCLA's campus is its layout: north campus is almost entirely devoted to humanities (and the FIlm/TV school as well as the Theatre school). South campus houses the science labs and engineering buildings.",

By studying with others, creative solutions were discovered more quickly to problems that we all had with the material. I was able to recall the knowledge and apply it, not just regurgitate it for and exam or quiz. I would tell myself that it would not be easy at first, but in the long term, would pay great dividends through both my GPA and overall knowledge base. Asking for help should have never been a sign of weakness in my mind, as it is one of humankind's greatest strengths! Every human has to learn from another, building upon knowledge and inventing new ways to examine the world around us. We are built to learn from each other and we all need help sometimes.

It is definitely possible that some colleges are NOT for you- but it is YOUR choice to decide which direction you choose to take in life (keep in mind your academic goals, personal goals, and financial goals). It is YOUR choice to decide what you'd like to study and spend your time doing. \nTime will go by fast and doubt will always fan the flames of your fears but as you challenge yourself and grow, note that every decision/path has a lesson to gain. Especially, those moments that don't go 'as planned'. \nSo do your best to prepare yourself for the worst scenerios but embrace the moments when things are great and even when things are terrible- because being in college is a privelege and although some things in life are out of our control- it's all still a gift.",

Factoring in the opinions you assume the people around you have is not only inaccurate but it is an incredible waste of time. Use your power of will and thought to decide that you are good enough simply because you exist. Base your idea of who you are not on the ideas or thoughts of others, but on the ideas and thoughts of you. Life is too short to wrap yourself in a blanket of worry that does no good for anyone, and in all honesty doesn't have to exist.

Check out clubs or groups on campus, either centered on things you know you like to meet new people with the same interest, or on things that you  have vaguely heard of to learn more about them.  Rush a sorority or a fraternity to see what it's like.  Take classes in subjects you may have never known you loved or known you were good at.  Be social and reach out to other students in your classes or in your dorm.  Do all of this to make sure you haven't pidgeon-holed yourself into whatever college experience you think you're supposed to have.  But, just as importantly, make sure that you are still alotting the appropriate amount of time for your studies.  The focus of your studies may change a few times throughout your college career, but there should still be goals in mind at the end.  Whether it's learning more about or mastering a certain field, or building a foundation for post-college life; actively work toward that goal.  Balance is the key.",

Numbers don't mean a thing. You and what you can do with your resources are the only thing you need to showcase and the right resources will present themselves to you.",

All the things I have been through have lead me to be where I am today; happy. Too often we strive for the wrong form of gratification- a new car, a passing grade, or reserving a spot in our hearts for someone temporary. Pain and suffering is short-lived in comparison for what is to come. I have yet to experience some of the greatest days of my life, and everything that leads up to that moment of complete satisfaction and bliss is going to be worth it because once I am there, everything I went through will feel worthwhile. So I would just watch that girl and let her experience life from the heartaches to the happiness, and I would let just look at her and tell her \"there is so much to look forward to.\"",

While a psychic reading would\u2019ve been helpful during my senior year of high school, I shouldn\u2019t have worried excessively. Embrace the present to ensure a better future. \n     If procrastination were a deadly sin, I would\u2019ve gone to hell long ago. All-nighters won\u2019t disappear until you modify your habits. I\u2019ve sprinted\u2014up stairs and hills, through major crowds\u2014to English classes on essay due dates. If I allotted myself more study time, I could\u2019ve spent less time in the floor lounge at 4am, eyes glazed over my computer screen.\n     Prioritize academics without sinking. Now and then, explore the local beach or museum. These are incentives for hard work.\n     Study to understand: not just to reach a benchmark. B+ instead of an A-? Oh, well. It\u2019s more remarkable to discuss class material and apply it to daily conversation. \n     Sometimes, embarrassment is essential for progression.\n     Enjoy college life while you can. Even when facing homesickness or academic, health, and personal issues. Difficult times are temporary; your harnessed mental strength is an everlasting asset. Above all, amazing college memories outweigh unpleasant ones.",

Create a few plans for your desired college path and discuss obstacles you may potentially face that way you have alternative plans. Become aquainted with financial terms, create a financial plan early on, and try to minimize the debt and loans you will take on. Try to establish a group of friends in every class, organization, or activity you participate in that way you have great networking potential and at the same time new friends to ask questions if you forgot something or to just socialize with. Try to figure out the right balance between your academic and social life, if you are looking for a more competitive career you will naturally have to work harder on the academic side. Analyze the habits you previously had and ask yourself if you are spending your time in the best way. Most importantly enjoy what you are learning in class and outside of class and to appreciate the opportunity to participate in the transition state from high school student to college student, an opportunity not everyone is lucky enough to experience.",

Intelligence might have made you stand out in high school, but your work ethic is what matters in college. But, if you feel like what you are doing is not right for you, stop. You choose your life path, not your parents. Quit having that attitude with them and they may actually understand. Expand your horizons. You are never going to have more freedom and opportunities to try out new interests as you do now. Not everything is for resume-boosting and how else will you figure out where your passions lie. Be frugal but not too cheap that you miss out on experiences you only have available now. From LGBTQ*, adoption, depression, suicide, poverty, and rape victims, you will meet a diverse range of friends in college from all walks of life. Don\u2019t judge or assume. Everyone has a story, a struggle, a reason behind their actions. So, never be too busy to be a good friend, sister, and daughter. You don't want to lose your heart in pursuit of your brain.",

In high school I was less assured than I am now and would constantly change my opinion based on the whims of others, never quite feeling confident in my choices about college and my education. \n\nI would say to myself--don't worry. Don't put such an emphasis on making sure everything followed this preplanned script you had written in your head and realize that chance is the spice of life. I would tell myself to seek adventure and to follow it wherever it may lead. To enjoy the moments of being young and carefree, knowing you might never have the opportunity of reliving it again if you are too focused on becoming an adult. Everything has its time and place. Trust that the universe has a plan for you if you allow it to guide and show you as Paulo Coelho might say, \"your personal legend\". The transition like all transitions in life will be difficult and may seem overwhelming but with conviction and a willingness to take advantage of any chance that comes your way; success will naturally follow.",
                "Joshua": "My first year at college took hard work, perseverance, and all the other inspriring catchphrase words that go along with success. More than anything else, though, my time at UCLA took patience. I was in a long-distance relationship for most of the year, and for several months, I was helping a friend through depression. A girl I know, who suffered from drug-induced psychosis, developd an inexplicable attachment to me, and one of my closest friends had an emotional breakdown and channeled her emotion entirely toward me.\n\nAlthough the year ended well with everyone safe and content, I would have appreciated a pep talk. I don't know whether anything anyone said to me my senior year of high school would have truly prepared me for the trying times to come, but I am choosing to believe that, in a world in which I could travel through time to casually give myself a few words of wisdom, I would also have the power to say the words my high-school self needed to hear: \"Joshua, college will be different than anything you have ever done, and it will be challenging in unique ways; be patient\" (or something like that).",

However, this perception that certain things were \u201cbad\u201d and that \u201cgrades were everything\u201d caused me to sabotage my happiness in college. Therefore, I would encourage my high school self to realize that grades merely one ingredient of the cake of life. It is far better to spend the energy that would have been used worrying about the grades on working towards achieving balance and joy in life. As a student with a 3.971 GPA from UCLA, I always defined myself by grades, but now I realize that they are merely one minor reflection of ability. This false perception often drove me past the point of balance to the extremes of chronic stress, causing me to push away all opportunities beyond the classroom.  Now I realize that I cannot forsake cultivating the other ingredients for this one. As I enter law school, I know that I will heed this advice so that my cake of life will be infinitely more delicious as I mix together the full spectrum of ingredients.",

Such a huge part of my education at UCLA was being suddenly dropped into this new community of 30,000 students and having to keep myself afloat. The failures and successes of the first years of college hold equal stake in making me the person I am today. It may seem like giving yourself advice that may help you avoid life's challenges or difficulties is a no brainer, yet I can't help but think that without some of that struggle I may not be the person I am today. I learned so much in college in the classroom, but also by being thrust into new life situations, both helping to mold my mind and personality to make me the person I am today. For as many mistakes as some well placed hind sight advice may be able to help me avoid, I would miss out on so many valuable lessons. So I guess if I had to go back and tell my high school senior self something about life and making transitions into college it would just be relax and have fun with whatever life tosses your way.",

And to get used to the heavy workload that I always complained about in school. But to not stress myself too much because college is not that bad and it is fun because you get to explore different boundaries and many things you had never even thought about. I would finally tell my old self that it does not matter what college you go to but how you take that opportunity to make something great out of your education, and use that education to help others.",

Your professor won't even notice you're not there anyway. You could just get the notes from a friend or from the textbook, if you're lucky enough. But why sleep in when there's still so much to learn. There are so many people to meet, so many connections to make and so many people to touch with your personality. Sure, in the end those grades will get you steering straight on your career path, but will you be happy? Will you be satisfied with all that you've experienced and learned in high school and beyond when you really are in control of your life?

You might not realize the part your parents have played in keeping you grounded and motivated, encouraging your talents, showing up to your performances; in college you will. When you really are in charge of yourself, your parents' constant advice will help you make the best choice. Even if you don't \"listen\" to them, listen to what they have to say and store it in the back of your mind. It will come handy at a time you most need it. Say thank you because they have given you all the tools to make it into college, and now you are boundless.

None of my friends went to my college, and I was petrified by the enormous campus with thousands of strange new students. I did not want to risk starting a conversation with any of them, because I was afraid that they would not be friendly to me. Despite sitting in class with an auditorium full of students like me, I felt incredibly lonely.\n\nThis would last for a semester. After a dull winter break, I decided to start making friends on day one of second semester. I talked to anyone I could see \u2013 roommates, classmates, even someone I met in the elevator; most of them were incredibly amiable, and many became my friends. A month later, I had already made several best friends. I talked to them when I was upset, they trusted me with their secrets, and we enjoyed spending time together.\n\nIf I could travel back in time, I would advise my high-school-senior self to talk to everyone starting on the first day of college. Most people are welcoming and affable, and the benefit of having friends is critical to have stellar college experience.",

Doing community service hours, joing a  sports team, or a club. I would tell myself that in order to get into the University of my dreams, I would have to work hard for it if I really wanted to get in. Lastly, I would not leave wihtout making the best of my last year in high school. Everyone always said that high school is one of the best times of your life. That could not be any truer now looking back. I would tell myself to participate in every single activity I had that year because later on I will either reminisce about it or regret not doing so.

Definitely do not procratinate.\nI know this is the first time that you will be sharing a room, but it is not so bad.  Make sure to respect everyone and their space.

Many of the insecurities that haunted me during college stemmed from being insecure with my weight. If I did not gain weight freshman year, I would have been able to focus more on important things such as studying and networking instead of worrying about my weight. I would have been confident in my appearance. I truly believe that my significant weight gain placed a damper on my college experience. I experienced drastic weight gain and loss throughout college because I could not get my eating habits under control. Although I exercised regularly, it could not combat my eating habits. Fortunately I was able to gain control over my food consumption during my senior year of college and have an amazing year. I wish that all of my college years had mirrored my senior year. I credit my overall happiness and confidence to being secure in my physical appearance.",

More importantly, I would tell myself to have greater self-confidence about going oout on my own and making critical decisions.  This I believe is the most significant advice because it is vital on the path to adulthood to make your own decisions, take care of yourself, and learning to stand on your own bootstraps.  Therefore, I would tell myself to be resolute in entering a new world and not to be afraid of meeting new people.

If we had used statistics and proven our data mathematically, we would've had a stronger argument to an already creative, innovative, and interesting project. Lastly, I would've said to study more seriously. I studied, but I was one of those students who was usually pretty well off even without studying (I still made good grades!).

The student life there is great and only complimented by the diversity of classes you can learn from. We have classes that will suit every individual's tastes like Classical Chinese Poetry, Brazilian drumming, Gospel Choir, Photography, Atmospheric Studies, and many more.

We all seem to appreciate the beauty of our campus and work hard to keep it clean. Every day as I walk to class, I see Bruins happily pointing out the remarkable buildings and gorgeous scenery to a visiting friend or family member. I can hear them proudly telling every personal memory and ridiculous myth that lies behind every structure in hopes of spreading some UCLA joy. That is true school spirit.",

I've never considered the environment I grew up in to be narrow minded in any sense of the word, but one of the most striking experiences about UCLA was realizing just how expansive it felt. It was like my world clashed with so many new ethnical, societal and lifestyle conceptions and revealed a hole to the rest of the world. No matter how far reaching I thought my viewpoint of the world was, the best part of college is proving that it can always be expanded.",

Political views matters, if a student has different political view then the professor has it could cost him/her bad grade. Envirnoment in general is afflunet class oriented. It is not possible for a middle class student to work and study fulll time to in order to get financial aid and maintain good grades. There fore the schooling limits for affluent class to succeed.",

For example, I joined a dance team called VSU Modern as a first-year with no prior experience in the field; I am now one of the lead dancers in our performances. I never would have imagined myself in such a role without that initial opportunity UCLA has given me. You end up finding something you love without even knowing it.",

In addition, UCLA professors challenge their students, encouraging them to think critically and apply what they learn in class. For example, in many of the undergraduate courses that I took as an anthropology major, my professors encouraged students to partake in some form of ethnographic or anthropological fieldwork, giving us the opportunity to take on the role of being a real anthropologist.",

Although I thought that I would be lost and alone my first year, it is always possible to find somewhere to belong where people care and share your talents. It\u2019s all you could want from a public university, with the benefits of a private one.",

There is always something to do on campus and it is just an overall fun environment that I highly doubt most other colleges possess.  The people here are great and I love being around them.  The community I live in is full of people that I have grown to be really attached to.  It has made the transition to college much easier on me.",

There are not many campuses where you can find students who are pre-med, pre-law, engineers, international relations, and film majors all at once.  Also, not a day goes by where I don't hear or see someone from a country half-way across the world.  Plus, who wouldn't want to live in L.A.?",
                "Sarai ": "The best thing about my school, academically speaking, is the discussions. Due to the large classes, students are split into different discussions. Surely, the Professors do a great job  at teaching, but discussions help us fully grasp the concepts taught. I once heard that education is what is left after you forget what was taught. Discussions help us turn what we learned into actual education.  Now, referring to the campus, its size and location are probably the best part about UCLA. The long walks to class with L.A.?s beautiful weather makes it a pleasure rather than a hassle."

So yes, we study, but no, we have friends and things to do aside from studying.",

In my own experience, that's far from accurate - we live in the middle of Los Angeles! If anything, there's too much 'social life' distracting from 'academic life'. The student body is so large and diverse that it's impossible to stereotype anyone - either that, or we have a solid representation of every stereotype imaginable.",

True, that you must've to had worked hard in high school to get accepted to UCLA, but once you're here, it's you that makes the best of it. Personally, I study hard and am involved in many other extracurricular activities that provide that social aspect to my college experience. There are a ton of things to get involved with here--fraternities, sororities, clubs, philanthropy, just to name a few.

In retrospect, I could have mapped out which courses I absolutely had to take and when so I could plan to take non-major classes around them.

                "Lesley": "The worst thing about UCLA is a very difficult question to answer, because UCLA has many great qualities. Although the population of students that attend UCLA is a difficult aspect to get used to. Major lecture halls can consists of up to 200 students and this inconvenience limits the amount of one-on-one interaction students can have with the professors. The struggle does not stop in the lecture halls, but continues onto the disscussion sections where classes are also made up large sum of 30. It is a struggle to establish personal relationships with both professors and T.As.",

                "Charlotte": "There isn't much about UCLA that is bad, but if I have to pick something I would say that sometimes the processes to deal with academic holds or issues can be frustrating and longer than necessary. It can be a hassel especially if you have to go to multiple offices to get different signatures and such when not everyone is in their office at the same time. Other than that, I feel like UCLA has a wonderful system.",
                "JuYoung": "I think the overpopulated campus is the biggest problem in UCLA. I have heard that although UCLA is the smallest campus among the UCs, it has the largest population. It creates chaos during enrollment because us students rarely get the classes we want and need to prepare multiple alternatives. From my personal experience, studying for a class I did not want became a burden throughout the quarter and, frankly, it showed in my grades.",
                "Jessica": "The worst thing about my school is the lack of ethnic and racial diversity. The majority of the student population is comprise of Caucasians and Asians, which often tend to stick to the their own ethnic group in both social and academic settings. As a Hispanic of lower socioeconomic status, I find it a challenge to engage with these students becase we come from very different communities and culture. Because of the majority of the student population being Caucasian or Asian, I can rarely find people of my own ethnicity to relate to.",
                "Laura": "I think the worse thing about UCLA is the professors.  I have found a few professors that I really like and enjoy learning from, but many more that do not communicate the material well or plain do not care about the students' success.  It is typical to be tested for a Final on material you never talked about in class.  It is also typical for students to forgo taking a necessary class because there is a horrible professor teaching it, instead taking it the next year or even changing their majors to avoid taking the class.",
                "melissa": "The worst thing about UCLA is the racist climate, at times, made by predominantly culturally-insensitive caucasian students towards minority racial and religious groups. This has been the topic of debate the past years I have been there since there has been numerous racially charged incidents and the chancellor has either dismissed these claims or addressed them in a passive and non-impactful manner. Besides these incidents I love being at UCLA I just wish students were more culturally and religiously aware without being so judgemental and ignorant.",

                "Alexander": "I feel that difficult dialogue is not encouraged at our school and conformity is encouraged instead of intellectual discussion.  Forums for debate are few and far between and most students are hardly ideologically challenged.  I feel students would be able to grow more academically, emotionally, and spiritually if students were encouraged to challenge their set beliefs and opened their minds up to novel schools of thought.",
                "Serina": "The worse thing about UCLA is the hills that the school is built on. These hills cause parking to be nearly impossible to find, for biking and scootering to be hindered especially while travelling between campus and the dorms, and for skateboarding to be dangerous to both the skateboarder and the pedestrians. The hills lessen the amount of students that live in the dorms to go into the city because they don't want to go back up. The hills force people who don't want to exercise to do so just to get to their classes.",

It is an overall stressful and serious environment, where most students are completely focused on academics, with little room for much else. As a result of grade curves, many students are reluctant to help one another or to work together, making UCLA a hostile environment at times.",
                "Onel": "Although my school can boast about its diversity racially, it feels like all the students are still clumped up into their own races.  I feel this is the worst thing about my school.  Since the population is great, people need to find people that they have most in common with and usually this is race.  I konw for a fact that this was the case for me.  This is the worst part because although UCLA boasts of diversity, people are still deprived of learning about another's background and lessening the differences between one another.",
                "Amber": "To tell you the truth, I absolutely love UCLA, so this is a very difficult question for me. I do have to admit though that pretty much every day when I walk to class, there is always someone trying to either get me to join a club, talk to be about a controversial topic like religion, or talk to me about some cause or other. This can get a bit annoying, especially if you are in a hurry to get to class and the person trying to talk to you gets angry with you for not listening.",
                "Alison": "Honestly, there aren't any extremely negative things about UCLA that I have noticed thus far. But if I had to choose, it would be that the major I am interested in, Communication Studies, is very competitive and hard to get into.",

However, tuition costs are high here and signing up for classes is difficult because of the sheer amount of students that attend this university.",
                "Shelby": "I would argue that the worst thing about our school is the cost. As a public institution in Calfornia this school should cost much less than it does. Tuitition has been raised over the past few years and is continuing to be raised.",
                "Miguel": "The worst thing about my school, is probably the worst thing about all of the other schools. There is a certain degree of fear at the idea of going on an adventure, without being familiar with the landscape. This can actually turn out to be a avery good thing, because from the adventure that is going to college, a student can find paradise and treasures. (literally)!",

                "Arthur": "I would have to say the food even though many people claim that is one of the best things about UCLA.  Although I won't deny that the dining halls have delicious food, that food is quite unhealthy for you.  For example, the grilled cheese sandwich is an item available everyday at all three dining halls and is quite tasty but has over half your daily salt, over 30 percent of your daily overall fat and over 60 percent of your daily allotment of artery clogging saturated fat.",

                "Vanessa ": "The counselors. Most of them really don't know what they are talking about. They led me down the wrong path many times and messed up my class schedule. You have to find one really good counselor and send him/her emails. You can't ask to see a certain counselor; they assign you a random one each time.  Don't trust everything they say. Try to find a knowledgeable upper classman and ask them.",
                "Andrea ": "The class sizes are too big.  Most of my class sizes had 60-150 students.  This is challenging to get to know the professors well, especially if you need a letter of recommendation from them.  Also, counseling services are not very good.  You are a small fish in a big pond and you really have to fight for an excellent academic experience in such a huge university.  If you need to be held by the hand, do not come to UCLA, instead go to a smaller private school that will give you one on one service.",
                "Bounrod ": "The worst thing is signing up for classes; since there's a seniority system, first and second years have it the worst.  It's also really competitive to sign up, seeing how the number of seats per class is capped at a certain number.  So, you might not get to take that class that you really want and that fits perfectly into your schedule.",
                "Linda ": "The hardest part is signing up for classes. With the budget cuts, smaller and fewer lectures means that students can't be sure that they\u2019ll have their perfect schedule because many classes will fill up even before their designated enrollment time. As a freshman, unless you have lots of units from AP credit or community college classes taken while still in high school, you\u2019ll have the least priority. I have taken some classes with some professors that I did not plan for nor liked according to reviews; however, I ended up enjoying some and meeting my best friends.",
                "Danielle ": "Budget cuts have plagued UCLA and the other University of California schools. The cutting down of staff and curriculum combined with increases in tuition costs are asking students to be willing to pay more for less. The quality of my school has unfortunately dwindled before my eyes. The budget cuts have made enrollment in classes more stressful as students struggle to get into their needed classes due to cutbacks in course offerings. However, I believe that when the economic crisis is over, UCLA will overcome this.",
                "Lien ": "The worst thing at school might be the construction that never seems to end.  UCLA is always under construction and sometimes hearing the drillings and breathing in the dust can be problematic.  In addition, the school is located in Westwood, and parking is a hassle.  The cost for one day of parking, I believe has gone up to $9.  In addition, the cost of tuition has gone up about 30% this year!",

                "Natalie ": "The worst thing about my school would be the housing situations.  I am paying for college for my own, which means I have already taken out many student loans.   Housing alone costs 10,000 dollars a year, and that's if you are sharing the room with two other students.  The building is literally falling apart.  One morning part of the bathroom ceiling fell on a girl while she was in one of the stalls, and the windows aren't sealed so the wind blows right through them.  I believe the college should make housing more affordable.",
                "William ": "The worst thing I can say about my school is the number of students and how there appears to be no individual attention you can receive from classes or social situations. There is a saying that you feel \"like a number\" here, and I didn't believe it until I came here. People are generally open to you, but you realize that most people form their solid core of friends within a couple of weeks and it is more difficult to make friends if you aren't outgoing or put in the right situation.",
                "Ivan ": "The worst thing about UCLA would have to be the hills. Having to walk becomes a bit tiresome but eventually it's easy to get accustomed to. Other than this, UCLA is a fantastic institution to attend.",
                "Joshua ": "I have realized that there is a great disparity in the quality of the professorial staff at the university.  During my last quarter, the first and worst, I was taught by quite brilliant people; however, they failed to effectively \"profess\" what they knew and were to teach.  Moreover, the professors were hard to reach and inapproachable outside of the classroom.  In contrast, this quarter, I have what I believe to be the best of the teaching staff.  Therefore, I question what the university's standards for employing one in the teaching staff is and why this disparity exists."

In addition, anyone who wants to go to school in a small, rural town will not feel comfortable at UCLA because it is in large metropoolitan city of Los Angeles.  Also, people who are not looking to meet a diverse group of people should not attend this school.",
                "Rachel": "As I mentioned before, the culture of UCLA is very accepting. There are hundreds of clubs, events, organizations, and activities to encompass everyone's interests. No one should hesitate to apply because there is no one characteristic that would exclude a person.",
                "Joseph": "If you lack intrinsic motivation to succeed and do not have a strong academic work ethic, UCLA is most definitely not the school for you. The classes are not overly-challenging, but they do require the students to dilligently do their assigned work. The professors and Teaching Assistants will not force the students to do any work, but the students who tend to slack off and fall behind on assignments without a rigorous structure will not thrive in this academic environment.",
                "Alexandra": "I wouldn't say that there is a particular type of person that shouldn't attend this university; however, anyone that is not willing to work as hard as possible to be the best that they can be, and capitalize on every incredible opportunity that this institution offers would not be making the most of resources that this school has to offer.",
                "Amber": "If you're not prepared for a gorgeous campus, the rush of college sports, and great research opportunities, UCLA is not the place for you.",

                "Jazmin": "Someone that is not interested in taking their education seriously should not attend this school. Classes here are extremely competitive with many students that strive to recieve top grades. Therefore, someone that does not want to be part of this rigorous academic system should not attend this school.",
                "Lesley": "A UCLA student should not consist of slothful traits that does not prioritize his/her academics. Someone who is not passionate and does not have personal aspirations that UCLA can help achieve should not attend this institution. One who does not demonstrate the ability to maintain a high academic G.P.A while participating in extra curricular activities is also an unqualified contestant. UCLA is an institution that values personal growth through the use of resources. A student who does not take advantage of opportunities and resources presented to them should not expect academic or personal growth while attending UCLA.",
                "Christina": "Someone who is afraid of being challenged or faced with stiff competition and hard work should not attend this school. This school is not like other schools where everything is chill and students can safely balance school, partying, work, and extracurricular activities without a few stress acne breakouts. Nonetheless, there is still time for having fun and other activities besides academics if one makes enough time.",
                "Emily": "People who don't learn well on their own or can't put up with large lectures shouldn't attend this school.",
                "Laura": "For students that are interested in \"south campus\" majors, or math and science majors, the pace of the curriculum is difficult to adjust to.  I would suggest that students who read and work slowly or who need individual attention in order to succeed would have a hard time at UCLA.  There is a certain level of independent efficacy in terms of study habits and time management skills that students need in order to survive the intense classes.  This is especially relevant to those pusuing a medical profession because all of the pre-med classes are very cut-throat.",

Most students are very studious, and focused on school. The campus is very large and it is difficult to get to know people or to make friends. Class sizes are often very large, with 300-student class sizes being common. If a person is looking for a more social environment, other schools would be better choices.",
                "Abigail": "People who don't like big crowds and lecture halls of about 300 students should not attend UCLA. There are about 30,000 undergraduates and the campus is extremely diverse. So if you're very close minded, you should also not attend this school. Those who do not like big cities would not appreciate what Los Angeles has to offer as well those who can't handle 70 degree weather everyday. If you expect to party every night and never study, don't come to UCLA. This school is full of overachievers who party moderately on weekends, not every night.",
                "Yee": "Students who do not care about doing well and succeeding probably shouldn't attend UCLA. UCLA students are competitive and strive to do their best. If you do not want to put in the effort and give your all, you will struggle academically.",

                "Maria": "The kind of person who should not attend this school is a person who is not interested in becoming a well-rounded student. If a person is interested in a specific trade, an UC is not a good choice. Anyone who does not wish to contribute hard work to his/her studies is another person who should not attend an UC. However, a person who is willing to work hard, to network with others, and to explore curiousities with new-fjound enthusiasm, is a great candidate for UCLA.",

                "Dieu": "Everyone can get something out of the school and also contribute back. However, sometimes students who are really closed-minded perhaps should not attend UCLA, because the campus needs students who are ready to learn, with questions that they could not ask in high school. As a community, UCLA is pretty tolerant, and values free speech that was hard-won by the Free Speech Movement in the 1960s. If a student is unwilling to contribute to the community of knowledge and action, then he or she should think twice about coming.",
                "brian": "people who like small school schools",
                "Arthur": "Closed minded people and those unwilling to get out of their comfort zone should not attend UCLA.  UCLA is a place of great diversity that can really open your mind up to new things but if you aren't interested in expanding your intellectual horizons UCLA is not the place for you.

                "Jillian ": "Someone who wants everything handed to them on a silver platter shouldn't attend this school. UCLA is like the real world. It is a huge establishment and you have to make your own way whether it is in classes, social life, and careers after college. There are so many great opportunities at this school and great potential to have the best time of your life but if you don't go out and look for them it will pass you by.",
                "Richard ": "A person who should not attend this school is one who is lazy and takes this school for granted. Someone who will not work hard and someone who does not know where he/she is going.  It is definitely valid to come in undeclared and not know what to major, but when I refer to somone who does not know where he/she is going, I am referring to those who are extremely lost and do not know what they what to do with their lives in general. More specifically, those who are emotionally and physically unprepared for college.",

I also wouldn't suggest this school so someone who is very anti-social.",
                "Emily ": "I don't think there is someone that should not attend this school.  UCLA is an awesome university with a wide range of majors and minors for students to seek and engage in learning.  UCLA offers a wide variety of majors and minors for students as well as organizations for students to participate and receive the help they need like tutoring.  One should not feel that they do not belong in this school, it is competitive but I believe anyone has the pontential to strive at UCLA.",

                "Lee ": "UCLA is definitely a school for the focused individual.  The academic paths here are endless and would be overwhelming to anyone uncertain of their goals.  Any student seeking to simply receive a diploma and enter the workforce would not benefit from the majority of what UCLA has to offer.  Faculty expect students to be active professionals, as they themselves are, and students who are not afraid to carve their own career path would do well at UCLA.  Conversely, those who shy from these challenges would most likely not find success here.",
                "Hannah ": "Someone who shouldn't attend this school is one who is not willing to be exposed to lots of diversity, one who doesn't know how to be independent, one who is afraid to make things happen, and one who is not driven and motivated to succeed.",
                "Brianna ": "People who don't put their heart into what they are doing shouldn't attend this school because it takes a lot of effort to succeed at UCLA.  It's a huge transition from high school, so if you're not willing to do the work, there's really no point in attending.  Not to mention it's extremely hard to get in here, so if you do, you should take advantage of the fact that you were selected and really dedicate yourself to your education.",

                "Lien ": "A person who is not  open to changes and challenges should not attend this school.  UCLA encourages student involvement and has many opportunities that students can take advantage of. \n\nMoreover, If students want smaller class size and need teachers who can actually teach, UCLA is not for them.  On average, class size can be anywhere from 50-100 people.   Most professors are researchers and do not have the skills to teach students.",
                "Erin ": "Students who are highly dependent on others to help them find a niche or path will not do well.  Because UCLA is so large and there is so much variety, independence and initiative are essential!",

                "Natasha ": "The only type of person who should not  go to UCLA is a person who doesn't care about their education. UCLA is a school for intellectuals to share their knowledge and learn from others. A person who is not openminded and who doesn't strive for excellence should not apply. UCLA prides itself on diversity and having a student population of people from all over the world, a person who is not willing to accept these fantastoc traits should not be apart of the student body.",
                "Suzzane ": "I don't think UCLA would be a good school for students with disabilities because there are plenty of hills.",
                "Allan ": "The class sizes are generally big, especially the pre-requisites such as chemistry and math. If you want extra attention and guidance, you have to work for it. Therefore, people who need a lot of help but are too afraid to ask for it or look for the answers themselves should not attend UCLA because they will get lost in the sheer mass of students.",
                "Janice ": "Those who are not academically driven should not attend this school. I know of several students who will study on weekends and make little parties of them, and if one is not willing to devote sometime to their future career by investing thoughtfully  in education, he or she should not attend this school. Having said that, there are a lot of resources to help one in classes, so this school is basically for everyone. Furthermore, I  would testify to a high degree of diversity (in race, interests, views, etc.) on campus.",
                "Amanda ": "If you're the type of person who is looking for an academically nurturing environment, in which professors and administrators are willing to hold your hand through the learning process, then UCLA is not the place for you.  Here, you are sure to participate in fascinating, cutting-edge research and attend classes taught by some of the most intelligent and successful people in their fields.  However, it's a bit of a sink-or-swim environment, which can be a little overwhelming for timid students.",
                "Jenna ": "Someone is does not like a big school and large general education classes should not attend UCLA. Furthermore, you yourself must work to get yourself aquainted with your professors, seeing as sometimes classes can hold up to 500 students in lecture halls. You must make the initiative to go to office hours and interact with professors who will assist you in your respective field. Therefore UCLA is also not for non-ambitious people.",
                "Kevin ": "To be a UCLA student, one must have initiative. A big public university is a bureaucratic system. School officials never think about what's best for an individual student; they act in the interest of efficiency. Here, students are just components of the university machine. If you aren't prepared to be aggressive about geting to know professors, securing spots in popular classes, and seeking out information on how to fulfill graduation requirements, this isn't the place for you.",
                "Stephanie ": "Anyone that is not used to having to work hard for excellent grades will have a very difficult time at UCLA. The university provides you with an amazing education and you most definitely have to put quite a bit of effort into your studies to excel."

Others' problems are not their own. Although we advertise ourselves as the pinnacle of \u201cdiversity\u201d, this is not synonymous with inclusivity. Often times, everyone of their own ethnic/racial group will only interact with each other, creating little pods of division. Even amongst minority groups, there is a clique-type atmosphere.

However, for the students like myself, who have known exactly what they want to do for a very long time, it seems like a waste of time and money to take courses that are completely unrelated.",
                "Brian": "Being a moderate sized campus with many students it was often diffcult to find a place to study or to sit and eat during lunch hours.",
                "Christina": "My school is extremely helpful. One thing that I do strive for is more help in creating a career. I also really would like it if affordable housing near campus was easier to attain. Another aspect may be agreements to help students move closer.",
                "Christian": "With all the academic success and drive the school spirtit sometimes gets lost in the shuflle. The lack of spirit would be ok if we were not such a powerhouse school at so many sports. UCLA leads all schools in total NCAA Division I championships, something that you might not know from looking at a random slection of students. Students hoping for the Wooden era level basketball entusiasm or a school that gets any sort of rivalry ferver may end up being disappointed.",
                "Brittany": "I prefer focusing on the positive opportunities at Ucla. I love how there are libraries to go & a beautiful hill to go to study. There are great professors that listen to my questions and are eager to offer help. It is astonishing that there are 1000+ clubs to attend to cultivate my interests in the business & medical field. Overall, I love every aspect of Ucla, there is so much to love, that the only  fustrating thing is that there is so much competitition. Though there may be competition, I find this essential because it encourages me to work hard.",
                "ricky": "It is difficult to enroll in classes so make sure to prepare ahead of time.",
                "Amanda": "The fact that there are around 40,000 students yet people still tend to stay in racial cliques.",
                "Jacqueline": "Refer to first question.",
                "Nicole": "The most frustrating thing about my school is the congested walk ways and long distances to classes.",
                "Kelley": "They do not seem to be overly efficient or organized. For the age of the school, they did not meet even the quality of the community college I attended previously.",
                "Kenneth": "The cost. Living in Los Angeles is a pretty penny in itself, but when you add the out-of-state tuition, housing, and textbooks into the equation the financial burden can be overbearing. The fact that I am in debt for more money than I have made in my life is frightening and demoralizing. It looms over me like a black cloud that can even make sunny Los Angeles seem bleak sometimes.",
                "Jessica": "The most frustrating thing about UCLA is that the classes are generally quite large and it's difficult to forge relationships with professors and to get professors to remember you, which can really hurt when it's time to get letters of recommendation.",
                "Joe": "When the dining hall offers only pizza, hotdog, and french fries. I think they could cook little better than that.",
                "Mirian": "There is not a frustrating thing about the university I am attending.",
                "Autumn": "The cost. It continues to increase every year and is already expensive for out-of-state students.",
                "Evelyn ": "People are very clique0y",
                "Richard ": "One of the most frustrating things about the University of California system in general, is the rising costs. It is becoming more ridiculous to finance an education at a UC, considering the many budget cuts. I wish there were more cuts in the salaries of some of the UC Regents, some of whom range in the 6 digits.  There also needs to be more transparency, especially in regards to funding and money.  In general, there is a need to redistribute and reprioritize where we spend our money in California. We spend more money on our prison systems than our schools.",
                "Yalda ": "Although it's more of a state crisis, the budget cuts are extremely frustrating. As an out-of-state student I couldn't afford the tuition before but now? It's nightmarish.",
                "Deanna ": "As a public school, it is sometimes very hard to get the classes that you want (though I haven't had too much trouble with this). Also, the tuition hikes are pretty frustrating.",
                "Safia ": "The most frustrtating things is that because the student body is so large, it is impossible to know everyone that you are attending school with.",
                "Karl ": "The most frustrating thing about my school is the challenge of completing a degree while being consistantly deployed around the world with the U.S. Military.  While online classes have alleviated many of the issues pertaining to the challenge classes with a more flexible timeline need to be implemented for those students who are working professionals.",
                "Michelle ": "Enrolling for classes is really tough because there are so many people. Everyone gets two appointment times to enroll for classes, and you really have to think about which ones are your priority.  Plus you have to find subsitute classes for all your classes and try to make everything fit into a schedule because you're guaranteed to not get at least one class that you wanted.",
                "Jasmine ": "I think the most frustrating thing about school is the fact that there are so many frustrating criterias and financial problems that are always on the back of the mind, and this impedes studying at certain times. I would love to study without worrying about money or deadlines and whether I have planned my schedule correctly; however, all of this does teach  someone how to survive, be independent, and responsible in the future.",
                "Angelica ": "The fee increase and budget cuts have been very frustrating and saddening.",
                "Jenna ": "The most frustrating thing about UCLA is not being able to get into the classes that you would like. If you are a freshmen, you are last to enroll behind and have to pretty much watch as the classes that you need/would like to take fill up before your eyes. You have to take the risk of going on waitlists sometimes, which is frustrating knowing that you may or may not end up in the class and must simply wait up to 2 weeks constantly checking if someone has dropped the course and a spot has opened up",
                "Jacqueline ": "The most frustrating thing about UCLA is the work load and difficult professors for Life Science Majors. All students seeking a profession in the medical field suffer with heavy work loads and challenging science professors. I love UCLA but it is frustrating to see other students having fun and going out while you continue sitting on your desk finishing homework and studying for the next test.  Another thing that is frustrating about my school is how  large the school is. Lectures have so many students making it harder for one-on-one communication.",
                "Jaswinder ": "Actually, I don?t find anything frustrating about my school.  Yes, I experience frustration, but I don?t actually blame anything within the school for it.  My personal philosophy is that my external environment is simply my internal worldview projected outwards.  If something in my environment makes me uncomfortable, it?s because there is something within myself that I'm uncomfortable with.  I feel that frustration is a sign that inner expectations need to be adjusted to match reality; changing circumstances that don?t serve my highest interests is much easier when I begin by acknowledging the way things are.",
                "Kenneth ": "The most frustrating thing about my school is the quarter system. It moves really fast. Sometimes test can come as quickly as week 2 and midterms as quickly as week 3. This does not allow for any slacking off. Slackers will have a hard time. In my case, I had personal issues that kept me out of school for a couple weeks. Missing a couple weeks in the quarter system can have a ridiculous  affect on your grade and understanding of the course because that is 1/5 of the total quarter.",
                "Michael ": "The most frustrating aspect of my university is the lack of availability of classes that are essential to graduating on time. Student are forced to remain at the university for an additional year because they have not completed the neccessary course work to have finsihed their degree in four years.",
                "Nicole ": "It is really big so it is hard to meet people. I live in a plaza, which is unlike a residential hall in that we have our own bathroom. Therefore, it is not a very social dorm. The classes are so big that it is connect to others.",
                "Marilyn ": "The most frustrating thing about school is the school fees. I currently working two jobs to make ends meet while I am a full-time student trying to get good grades. Being a student at UCLA, it is stressful to trying to do well especially when I am still new at being a college student. Everyday I look for ways to navigate through the system and looking for support in order to do well. As a first generation student, I am still trying to adjust to the college life especially when I am away from home.",
                "Jose ": "The most frustrating thing would be that there are many T.A.'s who really don't know how to teach and it is difficult to get the extra help from them which would be a given if the T.A. actually had some vocation for teaching.  One of the things one has to do in this case is look for tuturing and collaborate with friends in classes as much as possible in order to understand the material with greater extent.",
                "Alan ": "It is a very competitive environment, so you have to keep on top of the material as it comes along. This can be frustrating because you don't have that much time to sit and relax; you have to study every day.",
                "Andrew ": "The most frustrating thing about my school is probably the extreme liberal mentality that the students embody. I've always been more of a moderate when it comes to politics, and it frustrates me that people don't open up their minds to the fact that although there are social issues to care about, we also need to think about the economy. Students here often tend to go with bandwagon liberal thinking rather than researching political facts and statistics to influence their political beliefs and decisions.",
                "Jenny ": "Student to teacher ratio, price of text books, and soliciting",
                "Chelsea ": "The most frustrating thing about my school is the fact that there are so many clubs, guest speakers, performances and presentations available to the students, it is impossible to see everything that you want to see. At UCLA, there are so many opportunities available to you, it can be frustrating to  have to pick only a select few of the hundreds of fun and challenging events to attend.",
                "Samantha ": "Because of the California budget, the University is cutting many classes, so it is harder to find a variety of classes to enroll, especially for the general education classes. If you don't have priority passes to enroll in your classes, it many be difficult to find classes to enroll.",
                "Connie ": "Signing up for classes as an underclassman is extremely difficult because there are so many people and so few openings. It puts a lot of stress and worry into figuring out which classes to take and etc. Of course with the economy and recession, it has just been hard for public schools.",
                "James ": "I would have to say the parking or surrounding area.",
                "Jonathan ": "The student government at UCLA is inefficient and wasteful. If the student leaders would just set aside their differences and focus on serving the students (as they claim every year), going to school would be even more enjoyable.",
                "Yamanda": "Cut-thoat students, competiveness",
                "Lisa ": "The classes are rather large, and despite this fact it can still be difficult to enroll in the classes you want. Perhaps it's because I'm in a science major and the competition for pre-meds and engineers is cut-throat (at any school), but once in a while I have trouble getting the classes or professors I want. So far I've been pretty lucky, but I have many friends who are hardly ever able to enroll in the classes they want.",
                "zack ": "the flaming liberals",
                "Meera ": "Class sizes are too big.  It's very hard to get to know professors and feel comfortable asking them for assistance, or for letters of recommendation down the line. Also career services are not as good and as personalized as they could be. The career center cuts you off right after graduation when a good proportion of students still don't have jobs.",
                "Andrea ": "The class size and enrollment issues are very frustrating.  It also feels like a lot of times professors do not care about their students as mush as they should and that we are just one of their hundreds of students",
                "Elizabeth ": "The school is built on hills and is very large, so if you have to get to the opposite side of campus in 10 minutes you'd better run!"
