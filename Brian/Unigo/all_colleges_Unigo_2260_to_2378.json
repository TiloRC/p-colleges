You could memorize every book on the planet and if I asked you to ride a unicycle for the first time it just isn't going to happen.\n\nMy school experience if you have good school habits and stay on top of things you'll be fine. Many underestimate how much work it is and fall behind and this isn't something you can rush or cram like classes you had in the past.\n\nClasses and clinical rotations take up a lot of time. At its peak I was driving over an hour every day to different hospitals putting in 8 or 10 hour shifts then going to class at night and staying up late to study and do assignments. If you have a full time job you cant leave or put on hold or lots of other obligations like kids this will make the program very challenging.\n\nI had a 4.0 before the program and finished with a 4.0 for whatever that is worth. I was lucky to be able not to work during the program and I dont have any kids. It's not like other classes where you go once or twice a week for a few hours. There is a reason Sonography schools have such high attrition rates."

The staff and professors are generally very invested in their careers, as well as the future careers of their students. There are many majors and minors to choose from, each with specific technologies, resources, and programs to offer. Diversity isn't extremely high, which can be a challenge for some students. However, there are various clubs and groups catered to the interests and needs of each student. "

                "Comment": "This has proven to be the most apathetic and lazy student body I've met. The school has yet to develop any real \"college culture\" due to its young age and as such, caters to the lowest dregs of student. Drinking and drug use occurs on dorms every night of the week, roughly 80-90% of the student body is drunk on weekends, and the other 10% just keep to themselves to avoid the drunks. \n\nThis culture is pervasive in EVERYTHING, I've been on two different sports clubs, a choir, one acting club, two political clubs, one music club, and a languages club. Every last one of them routinely ended up cancelling events, skipping practices, or flat-out disbanding(language club) because their leaders and members were routinely drunk or hungover. \nThe club sports are hit the worst by this, if you're a somewhat competitive athlete, steer clear of them, people with beer guts make the workout regimens and it shows. You can work as hard as you want, but that won't stop the other 30 out-of-shape drunks from sinking your teams chances of winning against other schools. \n\nThe administration however, is where things really get ugly. Quite simply put, if you give them more money, they'll be nice to you, if not they won't help you at all and actively try to blame you. \nIt's a poorly-kept secret on campus that the administration has covered up multiple cases of sexual harassment committed by the rich kids in Greek Life. In one particularly extreme case from 2012,  a student in a fraternity that the School President's son was part of was, was killed via hazing. The school attempted to cover this up. \n\nIn day-to-day experiences, such as roommate troubles, IT problems, dorm repairs, and so on, the administration is just incompetent. \nIT services took 2 weeks to get back to me on fixing my meal pass so that I could get food(until then I had to beg for it from the cafeteria people). \nSecurity is poorly-trained and doesn't know the law, to the point where they'll ignore your texts/calls.\nThe administration will blame you if you bring up a problem with their system. For example, when I called them to explain that the air conditioner in my dorm was broken, they tried to charge me for it first, then when I proved that I hadn't broken it, it took them 10 weeks to come and fix it.\n\nIf you're a rich kid in business school, come to this school, they'll treat you like a king and even bend the law for you. If you have any ambition though, get away from this school, they'll make things harder and treat you like dirt.\n\n"

The campus offers countless amenities, a steak house, multiple swimming pools, as well as incredible up to date dorms. After seeing all of this it would be unfair to say my decision was not made on the amazing facilities and amenities made available to students. Fortunately, at High Point University the strong foundation of support academically is extremely prevalent throughout campus. With the support of success coaches who assist freshman students in transitioning to college and professors who are willing and able to reply to emails and questions at midnight, it is truly a great place to create and achieve goals as well as seek new opportunities for success.\n"

High Point is fantastic if you're blonde, beautiful, rich, and/or in a sorority,  but as a disabled student who stood out like a sore thumb, it was probably the last place I needed t be. I was bullied and ostracized by other girls, and after being the only girl to not receive a bid of a rush class of 150, I gave up and transferred to a state school. I'm not saying it will be like this for everyone, but be warned. The amount of hypocrisy displayed at High Point is incredible, and they really need to practice what they preach."

Just be mindful that if you visit the campus, all may not be as it seems. This school has a very Gilded feel to it. They will want you to drink the \"Purple\" Juice. It is a beautiful campus and the academics are phenomenal. Just look into the issues with the school before coming. I did not, and it has made me kind of re-think some things about HPU afterwards. Look up a particular incident involving Delta Sig in 2012. It was a truly chilling read. "

                "Comment": "High Point University is tends to go above and beyond with everything on campus. Everything from how beautiful campus is to what each of the teachers do inside the classroom. As a freshman, I have had the ability to connect with amazing people such as the co-founder of Netflix. If it wasn't for High Point, I would have never had these opportunities. Coming from the streets of Cleveland, I have worked hard and received many scholarships to go to this university. Most students here come from families who are millionaires and are very successful. Even though I do not come from money, I love High Point and fit right in. The atmosphere at High Point University is very calm and relaxed yet everyone is driven for success. Everyone dresses nice when they go to class, some professors require you wear business professional attire. We, as a student body are learning that business is an art, and human interaction is unique with each person. Being a life long learner is key at High Point and understanding that each person can be extraordinary in their own ways.\n\nBecause of High Point's connections and work I have created throughout this first school year, I was able to receive a graduate level, paid, internship this year as a freshman! Different opportunities like these are worth so much more than simple money... yet money is key to being able to do many things. This is one downside of the University: it is very expensive. Without so many scholarships every year, I will not be bale to attend this university... which is now my home. It also is in an area that is not the best, yet I have never felt so save in my life when walking around on campus. I know a few security guards, just because they are always out, patrolling campus, making sure everyone is safe and are also so sweet and nice.\n\nEveryone down to the janitors are so nice. When I am studying in a building on campus, the janitors are sure to say hello and ask how life is going. Being proper and nice is what I think they try to teach us. High Point University is just like a community where everyone works together to help each other succeed. Now, I understand how all of this may not seem like a real thing... at least where I come from High Point University sounds fake... but I assure you, it really is like this. I aspire to be the best I can be, and basically all the students around me are the same... which is why I have to stay at this university. I am very blessed to even have the opportunity to go to this university for a year.\n\nJust like any other campus, this one has its faults. But the biggest downsides I personally can think of is when you walk past the fountains you may get sprayed and parking may be hard to find for my friends with cars. (But these really are not big problems, they are small annoyances that we all are grateful to have and laugh about quite often.)\n\nHigh Point University is reaching its 200th year very soon and I can understand why. A community of hard work, good attitudes, professionalism, and an eagerness to learn  can bread success. High Point University is ranked #1 in Regional Colleges South, #2 in Best Undergraduate Teaching, #20 in Best Value Schools, and #1 in Most Innovative Schools by US News for a reason."

You learned a lot in those AP classes, but you would benefit a lot more from some good stories and some fun group experiences. Also, stop trying to hang out with that one girl.

Knowing what makes you different and special is not only important for filling out job applications, but also in finding clubs that you want to join and just, simply, expressing yourself in the most true way possible.

When I was applying to schools my favorite was High Point Unniversity. I knew I belonged there for a number of reasons. But it was extremely expensive. So I applied to a few other schools as well.

But, it\u2019s this new environment that makes freshman year an adventure. Never again will you experience your first move-in day, or first dorm meeting. This is a fresh start and exciting experiences lie ahead so savor each moment, because freshman year flies by. But, be prepared to meet many different people with different backgrounds, morals, and ideas. Keep an open mind and get to know those who are different. Because, though they challenge your ideas, they often give you a stronger understanding of the world and yourself. As you experience new events, people, and challenges, you will greatly mature.

You\u2019ve got to stop procrastinating. Don\u2019t underestimate these essays and projects and wait until the night before to do them. That\u2019s not good for your sanity and it\u2019s not a good work ethic.\nLastly, stay grounded. Stay true to yourself and your values. Spend some time in God\u2019s Word and don\u2019t get too busy to call Mom.",
                "Khali": "If I could go back and time and discuss what college would be like to my high school self, I would talk about the simplicities as well as the difficulties. I would let myself know that I need to be ready and determined to finally be independent. I would say studying actually does pay off, so don't take it as something useless to do while in high school. I would want myself to know the importance of getting that few extra hours of sleep, nutrition, or time to read a few chapters in my textbook. Also, I would want myself to know the importance of having decent, trustworthy friends; people who are supportive in my dreams and goals are people I should call my friends. In the end, I would tell myself never to give up. Four years of an outstanding education is only the first step to a miraculous future.",
                "Laura": "If I could go back in time and give my high school self one piece of advice, it would be this; \"calm down!\" My entire senior year of high school was spent in a frenzy. I was constantly doing homework, participating in extra-curriculars, applying for colleges, and worrying about scholarships. I didn't take any time to relax, and thus spent my entire year in a state of panic. Once graduation was over, the panic continued. Now that I had chosen to attend High Point University, what if I didn't like it there? What if I wouldn't get along with my roommates? However, all this worrying was useless. Since my first day at High Point University, I have had no trouble adapting to my new environment. My roommates and I get along splendidly and I could not be happier with my choice of study. My life is no longer consumed by frenzy, and I am able to take time to truly relax. I should have taken my own advice in high school and calmed down. Even though I was unaware at the time, all the things I worried about would turn out better than I ever expected.",
                "Taylor": "If I could go back in time and give myself advice about the transition to college, I'd probably tell myself to get involved from day one.  I struggled with homesickness until I became involved in campus, and every day I regret not being more involved earlier in my college career.  Life really is what you make of it, I wish I had grasped the opportunities presented to me earlier.",
                "Brittney": "If I knew what I know now about college life  I would have told myself that I needed to study harder. I would tell myself that I don't have time to watch tv or listen to music and that I need to find things that can help me in college and apply it with me through out the years. I should have told myself to ask more questions when I did not understand what they were saying. I would tell myself that I need to practice more and study harder. I would tell myself to grow up a little more and take responsibility for my actions. I would tell myself to always think positive thoughts not negative thoughts. I would tell myself to believe that all things are possible and to never say never. I would tell myself not to say I can't but to say I can. I would tell myself to learn new ways to study and find which one best fits me. I would tell myself that I can do this and make all a's and not to have senioritis. I would tell myself to comprehend things better and to believe in my capabilities.",
                "Tiffany": "The best advice that I would give myself is to get seriosu about applying to college scholarships. I applied to a few on them my seniro year but when I was rejected from many of them, I gave up. I figured that my parents had enough money to be able to figure out a way to pay for all four of my years. During these last two years of being in college, I now recognize the magnitude of  how expensice college really is, especially the univesity that I go to, since it is a small private school. I would tell myself that I need to really think long and hard about the sacrifices my parents and grandparents will have to make to be able to send me to the school of my choice. I also would tell myself that I need to realize that things do not always just work out as they have in the past for me. I also wish that I would have tried harder to get a job off-campus during my freshman year so that I could have saved even more money to be able to continue coming to this great University.",
                "Jonathan": "If I were to give advice to myself as a senior in high school I would encourage my same outlook as when I first entered college. I was lucky enough to be apart of a team. I am a walk on for the varsity Cross-Country and Track teams. This really helped with my college transition because I immediately had a core group of friends. If I weren't apart of a team I would give advice to immediately get active and join a club or sport that interests you. This will help you not get home sick and feel connected to the school and other students.  I would also give the advice to try and live in an honors housing option where it would most likely be less noisey and chaotic. Some nights my suitemate last year would play music so loud that my bed literally would shake. My advice there would be don't be afraid to ask your RA or campus security to get them to quite down.",
                "Ray": "I would have told myself to apply to more schools earlier and try to take the SAT more than once. Had I applied to more schools, I probably would have gotten into some place cheaper and public and I would have had more financial rewards and money to spend so that I wouldn't be completely broke as a college student. I would also tell myself to learn how to manage my money and time better.  I would also tell myself to prepare for being away from home for very long periods of time and be prepared to not talk to the people you used to talk to everyday.  Learn how to make new friends and establish new connections.",

College is a place where I found who I really was and what I believed. Although I am not done with college I have had the best oppertunities. I am now part of a national sorority where I can meet and connect with thousands of sisters all around the country, and if it wasn't for college, I would have never known about this oppertunity. I have also had the oppertunity to make life-long, everlasting friendship. Yes, being in a sorority helped, but having campus work study jobs and wonderful RA's who planned events helped me make friends. In high school teachers always try to prepare us for college work. The homework and studying was difficult at first with so many classes and so much to read for each class. Professors gave us the oppertunity to hvae open class conversation and talk about future plans. We had times where we did on-the-site work in elementary schools or companies. College has really opened my eyes to a world that I am extremely excited to enter.",

I will show myself and my family that thru all of the sacrifices that there is a great accomplishment and reward in the end.",
                "Stephanie ": "When senior year comes around, senior are so burnt out from their other eleven years of school they feel this is their one year to relax.   But senior year is really the beginning to a very important chapter in a young life.  If I could go back, I would be sure to research as many schools as possible so I knew exactly which one was best for me.  After I narrowed it down to my top 3-5, I would apply early action to all of these schools so I could receive my acceptance letters early and decide exactly what school I wanted to attend without the binding agreement of an early decision application.  College is VERY expensive...tuition, fees, books, housing, monthly personal needs ...all of these things add up, so it is important to accumulate as much money as possible beforehand. I would begin early senior year, applying for as many scholarships as I could.   Every penny counts, so I would be sure not to overlook the small $500 or just $200 ones.  If I would have taken this approach when I was a high school senior, I would have more money to fund my academic career.",
                "Christina ": "I'd heard the words \"college experience\" thrown around many times during my journey senior year of selecting a school to attend, but the magnitude of that phrase didn't hit me until I was actually a college student. I am now a few months into my freshman year, and from the bottom of my heart I can attest to the fact that the college experience is, quite frankly, exactly that: an experience. I have gained the friendship and various viewpoints of so many unique individuals. I have opened myself up to new situations and broadened my sense of self. For once in my life, I feel as if I am gaining actual valuable knowledge from my teachers. I've learned my limits, gained independence, and discovered a new strength I never knew I had to persevere all on my own. College hits everyone in different ways, but the true value of the college experience lies within yourself. You'll know if you've made the right decision because the words \"college experience\" won't be a phrase; it will be just another day in the life, as I've come to find out.",
                "John ": "In my time at High Point, I benefited plenty from the advice and counsel of faculty and staff. Yet the most important lessons I learned outside the classroom. I\u2019d always been something of a self-starter when it came to academics; I also remember moments when I couldn\u2019t go it alone.  One of the first\u2014and toughest\u2014things to learn was leaning on someone other than a staff or faculty member for help. Without the help of classmates and like-minded students I don\u2019t know what I would have done. \n\n The second tip I picked up was not to take everything too seriously. Being a high-strung individual, I tend to hole myself up in a room and type, type, type. Many times I had to be prodded to go to events in Fraternity Row. My social life suffered as a result, and I lost out on opportunities to network as well (among other things). Thirdly--and finally--make the best of your time there.  During my four years, I was equal parts staff writer, political analyst, and pre-law student. Avail yourself of the clubs and events there, and keep an open mind.",
                "Cheyenne ": "I have only completed one year of college so far. In that year i have experienced a lot. But what i got most out of my first year was this saying, \"closed mouth's don't get fed,\" meaning that if you don't speak up and let people know who you are, what you want in life, and if you need help with anything then you will not get fed the important material, lessons, etc needed to succed in life during and after college. My university offers a lot to it's students and throughout my first year i was able to experience a lot by getting out there and asking questions and finding out how i can get involved with my schol. It's very important to speak up, especially with my professors because they are my stepping stones for me to get my degree.  In my first year, it's easy to say that i learned a valuable lesson that will carry me throughout life.",
                "Logan ": "My three years in college, split between two very different institutions, have been marked by duality.  At St. John's College, I studied alphas, betas, gammas and deltas (even though the Ancient Greek language flatlined thousands of years ago), completed Euclidian proofs on chalkboards, and discussed the ages-old Platonic question of ?What is Virtue??\n\nThe Classical Liberal Arts curriculum, though rewarding, was not for me.  So I transferred to a local community college. Many  often ask me which school is ?better,? but I don't consider the question in comparative terms.  A more traditional serving of courses?replete with supply and demand curves, election results, and logarithmic functions?is the practical  \"yin\" to the more theoretical \"yang\" at St. John's.  It has allowed me to examine the same fundamental human questions?why we act and react in the manners that we do?from the opposite side of the proverbial coin.  \n\nMy past three years of college have allowed me to define myself through diversity of experience.  They have  encouraged me to value  similar and different minds, making the learning process quite the opposite of its namesake; it is an end that I have come to value in itself.",
                "Carrie ": "It took me a long time to realize how important an education really is. I went to college straight out of high school and made a mess of it.  I was overwhelmed by my mother's death two months before I graduated from high school and was severely depressed for the next four years.  After losing countless jobs, becoming a single mother and being on welfare, I deceided it was time for a change.  So in the summer of 2009 I filled out my FAFSA and got accepted into Columbus State where I hope to complete their Science of Nursing Degree and obtain my LPN.  This time around I am very focused on my studies and acheiving good grades.  Without an education, you can truly cannot get anywhere.   Besides if I want my daughter to suceed in life she has to see me succeed and  know that you have to work hard to achieve your goals.  I try to speak to the young people in my classes about my experiences and how important it is to take advantage of this opportunity the first time around.",
                "Stacey ": "I have learned several life lessons that will help me not only when I am in college, but also after I graduate. I have learned to break out of my shell a little more in order to make friends and to really enjoy the college experience. I have found a Christian sorority that has some of the most wonderful, nicest girls in it and I have gained a lot of friends. I have also learned a lot more about myself and who I am and what I value most by coming to High Point University. I have also found out what I want to leave as my mark in this world and I have received a wonderful education from the professors here.",
                "Jessica": "As for going back in my senior year and giving myself advise, I would just tell myself to start working harder and to not take everything for granted because when you turn a certain age and realize that you have responsibilities, such as helping your mother get you through college, you mature and truly become an adult in a blink of an eye. I have always been more mature than most kids my age, but I didnt realize that seeing my mom struggle in order to put me through college would be a daily routine. I know that I had to help in some way and that it why I have 2 part time jobs and am a full time student.  Life is a great ride, it's just trying to make it through all the speed bumps.",
                "Joseph ": "I made great choices throughout high school because I had an older brother who went through the college process years before me.  However, I would of abused the dual enrollment a little bit more to transfer more credit hours to college.  If you start taking general college courses during high school, you can practically skip your freshman year of college and jump right into your major courses. When you transfer almost a semester of credit hours, you are saving thousands of dollars in extra tuition.  I will be graduating in 7 semesters because of a couple courses I took during my senior year, but if I took more the years prior, I would have been part of the 2012 graduating class instead of 2013.  Take as many college courses as you can while in high school because the public school system pays for everything and it counts towards college!",

Knowing what I do now, I would have told myself to get used to being outgoing, so that meeting people would be easier. I also would have changed my study habits as a senior because  in college, the schoolwork is more independent, and studying is a crucial part in succeeding in college. Good grades came easy to me in high school but I know now that I need to work harder in order to get those good grades. One of the most difficult times in high school came with friends and being taken advantage of. If I could go back, I would tell myself not to fret over people that hurt me, because there are people that you're going to meet in the future that care. I wish I knew that in high school, so that I would not have been so hurt by my peers, but my best friend and roommate in college has shown me to onlyl eave room for those who care rather than the ones that cause tears.",

Were I able to go back in time I would encourage myself to stay focused towards my goals and not let anything come between them and the future I see for myself.  As an accomplished dancer I limited myself to only one of my gifts instead of exploring my other talents.  Now in the Interior Design major at High Point University I realize that I should have pursued my artistic talents as well.  This would have enabled me to become a little bit more advanced in the areas of my studies.  I would go back and say \"Imani, you have so much to offer your high school become more active and don't allow yourself to become boxed in to one niche.\"  Again I would remind myself that this time of single-minded focus, experience and academic diligence will prepare me to arrive on that university campus and \"soar with the eagles\".",

Studying paid off because I made deans list, but if I prepared more in high school the transistion would have been smoother. Also, i would remind myself to be yourself and not change who you are for other people.",
                "Bonnie ": "I would encourage myself to look at several other schools with a much broader range of characteristics in terms of size and population make-up.   I would also encourage myself to apply to a lot more scholarships as financial constraints seriously damage ones time at college due to the forced uptake of outside jobs.  Furthermore, I would emphasize Greek Life more in an attempt to broaden my opinion of the Greek society as well as expand my social network which would, undoubtadly, have altered my opinions of the school overall.  Moreover, I would have pursued many more out of school research and internships as this school seems to be largely lacking in that area.",

I'm from the north and I go to  a school in the south. I found out a lot of things in my first year of college that i wish i new. I would tell myself that everyone was brought up differently than you, and a lot of people that go to college are still immature and live off of their mommy and daddy. I was shocked to find out how  many people are really fake and try to hard to fit in with everyone else. I would tell myself to always stay true to yourself and never try to please anyone  that doesn't want to be your friend. The last thing I would tell myself would be to never take anything you have for granted because when you look around, you go to an amazing school and a lot of people at High Point University forget that.",
                "Devon ": "College is about learning, not just in the classroom, but about yourself, too. Take time to try things you never have before, and talk to people you normally might not have.  It can give you a perspective you never would have known. I think the college atmosphere is important to achieving this. You're away from home, your family, and friends, so there's no reason to fall into the same routine. College gives you a clean slate to be an individual and gain insight from diverse people.  It teaches you to think more openly. While it's important to appreciate the unique qualities you have, it's also important to bond with others over what you have in common. We're all here to become more intellectual, experienced, and prepared to achieve success.  So, have fun, and make your time worth it.",
                "Carol ": "If I had the opportunity to go back in time, knowing what I know now about college, I would advise myself to stay focused on school no matter what. In the beginning of the school year it?s easy for freshmen college students to become tempted into making all the wrong choices; such as drinking, smoking, missing classes, etc. Students think that a little ?fun? won?t hurt , but this type of ?fun? is anything but beneficial. If I could go back in time I would warn myself not to be  easily tempted and I would tell myself that there are many other options for having fun that won?t hurt my academics and life. College is no joke and instead of wasting my time doing pointless things that won?t benefit my future  I would advise myself to get involved in various clubs that my campus offers instead of wasting time with other shenanigans. I would have also advised myself to make a plan that balances out school work first since stress isn?t something I like to be faced with. And most importantly i would have advised myself to relax and make time for myself.",

I was always in a state of drifting loftily at the top of my class and I was unaccustomed to having to put forth effort for my high grades.  Because of this, I never truly developed study skills and as far as I was concerned I would not need them.  I predicted college to be an improvement over challenge of high school but I failed to see where any concern was necessary.  If I could talk to that me I would suggest learning how to study effectively and manage time.  I would also tell her to start keeping up with her own affairs instead of leaving everything to her mother that way when she did get to college she could stay on top of financial aid changes and paperwork.  Finally I would have cautioned her against excessive spending and suggested that she save money for surprise expenses.

Coming from high school where you have to wake up at 6am, 8am does not sound bad but it really is.  In college, you stay up way later so it is much harder waking up early for class.  The next thing I would tell myself is to be open to anything.  You meet lots of different people in college and at first you may not be your type of person but they could very easily be in one of your classes or even your roommate.  College is all about finding yourself and learning life skills, such as living or dealing with people you may not like. So I would tell myself to make sure to keep an open mind with anyone I meet or any situation that presents itself because it very well could effect me somehow. The last thing I would tell myself is study! College is much harder than high school, so be prepared to crack open that textbook!",

The college I almost chose was well known for high class, wealthy students who partied hard and studied harder. I was afraid of being ostracized because of my low income, and I chose another school instead. The other school was rising in the academic world, and attracting many more wealthy students. Therefore, when I came to my new school, I realized that they were as conceited as I had thought the other school would be. Because I was scared, I ended up with more loans for a school with less prestige.",

I would also tell myself to do more scholarships, because I didn't realize college really is expensive. I would also tell myself to tell my friends that college isn't as easy as they thought it would be.

I would of also told myself to not do so great on my math placement test so that I could of been placed in a math course that I felt I was more comfortable in.  I would of made myself be more involved in my school so that my leadership skills and my ability to work with others would of been at great point.

This is my goal and I will make it even if I am not fincially able to pay for my tuition as I go.  College loans will become available if I pray for help.

I would have liked to go to a school in a city or at least in a so-called \"college town\" just to have had more of a relationship with the community. HPU is intentionally gated, and that isolates its students from the outer world.",

However, at HPU, there are only a couple of buildings that are offered at the basic tier 1 pricing, and these are, primarily, reserved for freshman students. The other tier 1 housing is off campus and you have to take a shuttle back and forth between your house and the campus.

Our school is great, and everyone loves it, but our president is more interested in marketing than satisfying those who are here."

                "Comment": "As a first generation college student, leaving the comfort and certainty of high school life was terrifying, especially when considering how I would pay for it all. At first I was a bit skeptical of going to Highline College, thinking it would be \"too easy\" or inferior to the expensive universities I couldn't afford to attend. I was pleasantly surprise what a good intermediate Highline College has been for me though as a student looking to transfer to a University. The classes are actually intellectually challenging, the staff is amazing, and the campus is beautiful. Small class sizes mean it is really easy to get in touch with a professor to ask about a certain concept that is confusing or hard to grasp. All the professors I have had are super friendly and most are more than happy to work with you on homework or assignments during their clearly listed office hours. \n\nThey also have a great library with tons of resources such as student mentors to help with almost any subject taught at the school. They even have student mentors that speak a wide variety of different languages if English is your second language, or if you just feel more comfortable talking in a different language with the mentors. When I'm not in class, I'm usually in the library studying by myself or with friends in the study rooms available for groups of students. \n\nWhether you're doing running start, want to attend for the full four years, or are looking to transfer (like I am planning on doing at the end of this year) to a four year university, I would highly recommend looking into Highline College, as it is a great introduction to college life with tons of student resources available to help make getting an education easier."

By that I mean, teachers are available to you, but it depends on you if you are looking for that extra help. I have taken the opportunity to really discuss assignments and future plans with professors and they have in turn given me many opportunities to try different programs and improve my academic abilities. It's definitely quieter than a university would be, but it's not uncomfortable. You know that everyone is transitioning here and you are a part of that process."

This means I have to wait a few more quarters, if not longer, and it will take me a lot longer to complete my degree. Paid parking is just ridiculous. The school is really old. One thing I like is my CIS teachers. This college has strict requirements to be eligible for financial air.

Expectations are usually laid out, but some professors just aren't responsive. As well, there are some issues with not knowing who your classmates will be which also can change how much discussion can happen in class."

                "Comment": "I think Highline has good teachers and a good curriculum for legal studies for their AAS/Paralegal Program and if you study hard you can get good grades and you can pass the program. They also incorporate an internship component which is vital to your learning and practical application. Highline IS an ABA ccredited school, which is important to employers. However, I feel that where they fall short is: 1)  that they don't really do enough practical pplication in making sure that the students know how to fill out the forms you will need to know \"on the job\", and you can really only get this through whatever internship you might do, and 2) When I attended the school they didn't have a very good assistance program for job placement services. I never really got a job as a Paralegal after graduation and it was never really explained PRIOR to enrolling how little Paralegals make (less than half of what I made before I enrolled).  My money would have been better spent getting my degree in the field in which I was laid off. "

It's basic and accessible and allows students to transfer to higher education centers pretty readily. Classes are reasonably varied and not too much of a commitment, and professors are generally affording and well-mannered."

I know slacking off seems so easy and I know you are smart enough to get everything done last minute. But trust me, it's not worth it. Going into college you're going to see that you want to do the same thing in high school. Don't do it. You will regret it in the long run. You have the power of knowledge and you are the first generation graduate of our family. Set the highest stepping stones for your younger siblings to follow not the lowest.

Also, I know you feel prepared to go to college in the Fall. But you're not ready. You are far from ready. High school was your safety net and it's not going to be there when you go to college. When you go to your college orientation, don't try to force yourself to make friends. Don't compare yourself to other student's accomplishments. This is where you get into trouble. Instead, go to the Advising Center to get some guidance because you're going to be all alone in college. You need emotional support most of all. When there are assignments you don't know how to do, get some help! Go to your professor's office hours and don't be scared to go! Also, stay organized and be aware of all the essay deadlines. See the end of the quarter in mind because it will come in a flash. Take care of yourself and find the motivation inside of you. You won't find it anywher else.",

In high school I rarely ever had to study or put any effort into my schoolwork, yet I was able to skate by with decent grades.  This was great for my life in high school- but terrible for my academic record in college.  Learning that self-discipline early on, even if it isn't needed at the time, will greatly benefit you when you hit college.  If you don't nail down the ability to turn off all outside distractions  for a few hours each day (socializing, work, television, partying) to focus on your schoolwork, you will spend the first year of school floundering, trying to balance everything and playing catch-up.  Good study habits are the biggest key to your success in college.",

Priorities change over time and mind definetly did. It has been over 15 years now since I have been to school, and I have decided to go back and get my BA in Ealy Elementary Education. Due to my priorities and my focus I can honestly say, I am very excited about moving forward with a Teaching Degree and being a straight A student.

If I could go back to myself as a high school senior, I would give myself the biggest hug I could muster and simply say, \"you are going to need this hug to get you through the next 14 years, but don't change anything because each and every experience has made you the person you are now, and that's something to be proud of\".  I don't have any regrets.  I needed to go through life experiences to get to where I am today, and without them I wouldn't have a beautiful boy, a true sense of myself, and the courage to face future obstacles.

By doing this it makes the semester much more interesting and I find it easier to retain the individual course material.  \n\nThe last bit of knowledge that I would pass on to myself would be to make good quality, like-minded friends, study hard, don?t give up, and to enjoy college life to its fullest.",

You don't get away with everything by smoothing excuses for missing homework with sweet words of flatteries to the professors. It's all about diligence and the ability to confront your laziness. Band is great is high school and FBLA is even more exciting, but by the time you get to College, clubs are no longer a place to involve only yourself and your enjoyment. It is a place to grow as a person and reaching out to better your society. I believe that you would go great if you heed these advice. I know i had a hard time coming to terms with changes of the life in college but so far, things are going well and it will only get better for me years from now.

While in high school i just thought that this was a way to keep us busy. I would tell myself now, that it's not. Doing the 13 year plan helped me prepare for the real world. \n\nOne thing I was not ready for was all the self discipline needed to stay focused and on top of everything. I would tell my self to practice time managment. How to balance a job, school/study,  and a social life. Going into college most students think it's going to be one big party, and for some it is, but for most it takes alot of responsibility and growing up. I didn't know that it would happen so fast, and i wish that i would have been more prepared for the responsibilities i was about to embark upon.",

I remember making friends with students from Mongolia (a country i have never had about). That means i will need to learn to understand and work with students coming from a culture that's different fom mine.\n        In college, the student is expected to do much more by themself and the lecturer only guides you.

Right out of high school are your experiemental years. Don't waste time and expenses at a University just to find out the major you intended on is no longer your passion. Myself for example, my mother lived a big portion of her life in Vietnam. She had minimum education over here in America. All she knew was that if I went to school, everything would be okay. But it wasn't the case. I felt like a prisoner in school. I hated school, so my grades weren't great (2.2). I had no idea where I was going and I was wasting large amounts of time and money. And 4 years later in college, I haven't completed anything. But through volunteer, out in the workfield, and people I encounter, I finally know what I want my career to be. Now I'm working extremely hard in school and my grades show for it (3.75). Therefore, my advice for you is to be patient with yourself and to do things for yourself.",

I would encourage myself to get better grades and not cut classes or hang out with the people I was hanging out with.  I also did running start in 11th and 12th grade, so during that period,  I would have told myself to be more assertive and use the time and resources I had to complete as much of my AA as possible. Now I am paying for my choices, but I am so thankful that I even have the opportunity to go to college and get a good education for my career! I learned from my mistakes.",
                "Lisa ": "The advice that I would give myself is that it's okay to be unsure about what you want to do, but you still need to have a plan. Meet with a High School counselor or an advisor from a college you're thinking about, but make a plan with someone. It's important to get an idea of what stepping stones you'll need to take to get to a general goal, even if you don't know the specifics. The details will come later, when you become more and more sure about (or should I say you discover) what you want to do. It's okay to not have every answer right now as long as you're moving in a positive direction.  It's important to meet with a counselor because they know the details about what classes you need to take, what grades you need to get and what the prerequisites to certain classes are. You don't need to stress yourself out about learning a new confusing system when you have someone who has mastered it and can tell you exactly what you should and shouldn't do.",

The classes are all about getting you to learn and retain the information learned about in class because real life experience comes right after earning your bachelor's. The on-campus apartments are great. They're safe and fun, feels just like your own place."

I would tell myself to study harder so i would have higher grades and make the top ten list. I would tell myself to talk to the teachers more and even get close to couple more than i did.  That way i could get more references than i had and not always use the same people. Also i would have more support through high school.  Im not sure about the transition advice becuse i did okay with tht. I was excited for a new beginning and to start college. My first semester went smoothly and i had pretty easy classes. The biggest advice i would give myself is to talk alot more, speak my mind and make my opinion heard. Also dont be afraid of public speaking, we have to do it at some point.",
                "Jessie": "Going back in time, I would have told myself two things, the first being to enjoy my time there while it lasted. Although, high school wasn't the most fun for me, I wish I would have made it better for myself. After high school there is a lot of growing up to be done and even though it doesn't feel like that's true while you're in the middle of it, it happens quickly. Being an adult isn't always fun, so I wish I would have cherished my time as a teenager. The second thing would be that I would have told myself to try harder. I should have pushed for better grades and got more involved so I would have scholarships and other opportunities lined up for me.",
                "Paige": "If I could go back as a high school student, I would tell myself to keep an open mind and never say no to an opportunity; give everything a shot because you never know if you will love it.  There were times within my college career that I listened to that advice and other times I did not.  My biggest regret senior year was not applying for Hilbert College's Honor's Program.  I was afraid I would not have enough time for it, knowing I was going to participate on the cross country team, so I threw away the application.  At the end of freshman year, I was asked to apply again and I did.  I love being a part of the program, it has made me become a better person.  Another opportunity I took was participating in basketball and lacrossse along with cross country.  I had never played lacrosse before, but now it is one of my favorite activities.  Joining the Honor's program and all three sports has allowed me to meet so many diffrerent people; each team is completely different than the other.  I have stopped living with regets once I stopped saying no to opportunities.",

                "Danielle": "The advice I would give myself as a student in college is learning about financial aid/FAFSA, developing better writing skills, and preparing for classes. As a junior in college I have no understanding on how to complete my financial aid. I believe in all High Schools there should be an optional college 101 class for those that want to attend college within their junior year. This class will prepare students with the knowledge of their own budget and what they need to complete their financial aid/FAFSA correctly. While attending High School I only received two ten page papers and now that I\u2019m in college I receive ten page papers in every course. At first I struggled and attended the tutors quite frequently because High School didn\u2019t prepare me for all these assignments at one time. As I prepare myself for classes in college it\u2019s very different than High School. In High School I was able to submit assignments in late without being penalized, but being a college student professors don\u2019t accept late assignments. I also believe I should\u2019ve token advantage of tutoring more and learning better study habits for quizzes, midterms and exams.",

                "Jasmine": "All through grammar school I was such in a big rush to graduate and get into Highschool, I was in a big rush to grow up. Once I graduated from 8th grade I was more than ready to be a freshman in Highschool. Those four years in Highschool were the best days of my life, I loved it. Once I became a senior reality hit me. Within twelve months I would be entering into a whole new world, the College world. If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior knowing what I know now about college life and making the transition, I would remind myself to stay focused. Entering into college I realized I had alot of freedom. Teachers were not chasing me down about papers, I didnt have a set bed time. I was pretty much in this cold world by myself. In College you have to look out for yourself because noone else will do it for you. I would tell myself to push for success because Failure is not an option. College is the next best step to further education. Do well, do your homwork. Stay focused.",
                "Sherita": "If I could go back in time and advise myself about college life and the transitional process, I would tell myself to seriously think about what I want to do with my life.  Parents and school counselors advise students about this all of the time, however, most young adults do not heed to their advise.  I feel that if I would've contemplated more seriously what type of career I wanted to pursue, then I would be that much closer to achieving my goals presently.  I would also advise a young person to focus on what they are most interested in doing instead of what others believe they should be doing.  If the student does not have a passion for the field they are pursuing it will result in a waste of time and money!  In focusing on the career choice that they are interested in, a student can take courses that will enhance their studies and get them that much closer to their occupation of choice.",
                "Angela": "If I could go back in time and speak to myself as a high school  senior, i would say this:\nFirst, the most important thing is time management. A balance between social and academic life. Your studies should always come first and it will take great discipline with your new found freedom.\nSecond,  you will meet many new people of different  race, ethnic, cultural backgrounds. Embrace and learn from those who are different from you.\nThird, you may have roommates, compromise is the key, as they may keep different study habits and hours . When all else fails, room by yourself.\nFourth, you will have great memories , and maintain life long friendships.\nLast and most important, you have gained knowledge, and a degree which no one can take from thee.\nThat is my advice to me.",
                "cashmere ": "The thing that I have gotten out of my first semester is that it is not high school anymore. College is something totally different from high school. In high school not showing up to class on numerous occassions was not a big deal, but in college not showing up to class can be a big affect on grade and lower down your GPA. Furthermore my college experience so far is that I have learn alot in the pass 4 months I have been here. There are some things I wish the school would do more concerning the social life, but the classes and the staff around the school are very helpful. They actually care about our education, unlike how individuals say the teachers do not care about you in college. So not true. Overall in my college experience so far I have learned a lot and made some mistakes, but I will learn later on as my college learning will continue.",

Yeah, I'm a drop-out and I regret it everyday now that I have grown up. Hypothetically, if I had made it, I would tell myself to enjoy the small things in life that are free and the things that are priceless. Take time to relax and don't spend so much time worrying about other people, worry about yourself. I would tell myself that bad things were coming my way but to hold on tight because I would be alright. To add to that, I would also tell myself to not be worried about the bad things that are coming, that it would only give me a headache and in the end it would make me a better person anyways. I would remind myself that I need to stay strong because I am a role model to many and people look up to you. Lastly, I would tell myself to not get caught in the moment, Life's too short.",

Don't get me wrong, I still did well. However, after being in college I  understand the difference between an A, and an A-. Other than the minute grading system, I feel as though I did pretty well.

                "gregory ": "The advice I would give myself is to finish high school on a high note academically which really helps in the transition from High School to college. I also would would encourage the myself to develope study skills as well as organizational skills. i have learned they are invaluable in the success of college life. To be succesful in time management is to set yourself up for success in the classroom.  Also, to own your education, back in high school your teachers stay on top of you for assignments and tests but in college you pretty much are on your own. SO you really must know when things are due and when your tests are scheduled from the sylabus that you are given the first day of classes.\nI also would advise myself to keep a balance on school and fun time. I have wathced a number of my friends struggle academically and be placed on probation because they fell so far behind in their studies that thier first term GPA is below a 2.0. \nSo my adive is to stay ahead of course work and study and review daily so you don't find yourself cramming.",
                "Jamie ": "The most important advice I could give would be to research perspective colleges.  Pay particular attention to enrollment status and procedure, graduate success rates, career placement, preparation for graduate school as well as programs or designated places for academic assistance.  One of the most important criteria is the size of the campus and the individual learning style.  It is important if a student requires more one to one learning to find a campus that is smaller in size.  I found that open houses can provide a great insight into the how the campus functions and the type of individuals that are employed and enrolled. It also provides a insight to how large or small the campus is. Personal interviews and tours and highly encouraged as they provide greater insight into the desired program curriculum as well as the professors within the specific program.  Communication is another key to success of the college.  It is imperative for all departments to be in constant communication regarding your academic and financial status.",
                "Andrew ": "The transition was not hard at all.  In fact, in some ways college seems to be a lot easier.  I always took 7 or 8 subjects in high school and in college, I only take five.  In high school I was there 6 hours a day.   In college, I am only there about 3 hours per day.  I would, however, have taken high school more seriously.  I guess college makes you realize that school isn't a joke.  \nCollege has made me realize that I want to be smarter.  I want to be one of those guys that has all the answers.  In high school I thought it was cool to get away with stuff.  I didn't realize I was only hurting myself.    I also would have spent more time on trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.  That is the hardest decision I face now.    I thought I wanted to be a teacher, but I am not sure right now.  It is hard making a decision that will affect the rest of your life.  But I guess that is what college is all about, finding yourself.",
                "Jarret ": "Work hard and carry that effort through with you, and never forget what got you here.  Keep focused and learn to balance school with your social life, more importantly, keep school first and friends second. Determination and hard work will help you obtain what you want most in life. Make sure to keep up with reading the books handed out to you in class because once that behavior is broken, it's hard to reobtain that train of thought.",
                "Amanda ": "Some advice that I would give myself would be to take things more seriously and put grades and school work before friends and fun activities. I would also say to be myself and accept my friends for who they are and I will recieve the same respect as them. Enjoy school but also study hard and get good grades.",
                "laura ": "to stay focus on school work, look at more scholarships and really find out what i want in a college.",
                "Rose ": "I would tell myself how to be a better roommate in the dorms. Honesty and being forthright are essential to maintaining a good relationship with your roommate. I would also warn myself about the rampaging gossip that spreads around campus. It spreads like wildfire and it is incredibly hard to stop or trace. I would tell myself to step out more, you don't have much of a college experience if you never leave your dorm room. I would also tell myself not to lose my values because of the peer pressure, it's definitely something a lot of people underestimate about college.",
                "Michaela ": "Finding the right college is pretty difficult. I personally started with college search engines like the Princeton Review, which start you out with information based on schools that best support your academic interests. I highly suggest visiting schools, as well.  It's like online dating; first you look at the school's profile, get to know the school better through research, and then you meet to see if there is any chemistry. School visits are key in the latter part. \n\n     Once you have chosen your college and gone through orientation, it is advisable to join something, anything, that will allow you to make friends and really enjoy your time on campus. Many people do go down the sports path. However, many campuses have clubs and organizations. Some of these clubs are even major-based, and will really help you not only in the classroom, but in networking. Other clubs are interest based. I highly suggest joining at least one of each in order to achieve a well-rounded college experience. Many schools also have on campus activies, as well as trips, in which a student aspiring for the college experience can participate.",
                "Molly ": "First i would say trully look at the high school experience. If they went to a big school and didn't do great i would say look at a smaller college, they may need more one on one experience to live up to their full potential. If they went to a large school and did well they may be fine going to a large or a smaller school and vise versa with smaller high schools. Than look at the area that the colleges are in. If they will be out all night in the city obviously you would want to go there to party and not the school. I also encourage campus visiting if possible. Gives you a sence of the college you get to see first hand what it looks like. Get involved with at leat one or two activities every year.  Dont be afraid to ask questions and get extra help you are not being a nerd if you do and no one will make fun of you for doing it. College is the steping stone from being a child to adulthood you will learn a lot about yourself enjoy this time next comes the real world.",
                "Eric ": "I would give parents and students the following advice in finding the right college for them and making college the best experience possible:\n\nFirst of all, my advice would state that when looking for a college, look at the best place where your son or daughter, or whoever the prospective student is, can grow the most. Usually big schools such as Yale, Harvard, Cornell, UB, Buffalo State, and others, are relatively larger in size compared to smaller private colleges that may offer better opportunity for community involvement and growth as an individual. Going to college isn't just to get a good job in four years, it should be looking forward to growing and maturing as a person as well.\n\nThis leads me to what can make the college experience the best one to have. The advice I will share with you, is get involved! Do as many activities as you can, and really learn how to manage your time! Play a sport, or join a club, or even take a alternative spring break trip.  Do something others wouldn't to make yourself stand out, and put those things on your resume!\nOverall, look for the most growth and involvment!",
                "Jay ": "First you need to  deceide what you want out of your college experience. Your the only one whom knows what you are expecting, and you are the only one whom can make it happen.  Your college exeperience is what you choose to make of it.  Whether your active or not, is up to you.  What you like to be involved in is also up to you.\nMake sure when looking for a college you are aware if staying on campus of your surroundings and if eveything you will need is close by. Grocery store, doctor, emergency room, gas station, bus route.  Also, when looking for a college you need to know what your learning preference is, do you like large classrooms, with lots of students? Or small classes, where it is easy for personal attention from the professor if needed.  To be good at what profession you have choosen  you need to go to class, pay attention, do your work, and be the best that you can be.  If you slack off, don't attend classes, turn assignments in late, then your grades will suffer, this isn't high school anymore, excuses don't fly.    Good luck and God Bless!!!!",
                "Rachel": "Find out not only what you want to become in college, but who you are as a person.

It's decent and it gets the job done. I enjoy the teachers and some of the experiences I've had. The students that go there are nice and if you're not interested in a crowd it's the perfect school for you with small campuses and small classes. If you take math at the Burleson location do not take Laster! Another things that's not that great is they go through advisors faster than they go through semesters, which makes it difficult to get comfortable telling someone your struggles and what you need help with. I had an issue with trying to take online courses they offered because they're having an issue finding people to take in person classes.  My biggest issue with Hill is the fact that none of my teachers email me back. I had to have surgery and was out of school for a month and 1 out of 5 of my teachers and replied. "

Once it came time for graduation and seeing all of the top GPA people walk across stage first, and then me just in the back, i didn't like that. Now in college, I have a higher GPA then I did in High school, and i work full time, and i am fixing to be a dad. If my priorities had been set straight in high school, maybe i would be at a four year school instead of a community college. But i guess everything happens for a reason.",

I was more worried about my high school GPA staying high, when i really should have been worrying about getting my college finished with. I also wished that I had taken out more time to sign up for more scholarships to help pay for school. In June after I graduated high school, i found out I was pregnant. So after my first semester of college, i only have 19 hours completed, thats including the two classes i took before i graduated high school. So now Im going to have a kid and classes to worry about. Mistakes happen, and i should have EXPECTED THE UNEXPECTED.

I would try my best more than anything to try and overcome my tendency to procrastinate until the very last minute, which is really the only reason I wasn?t able to attend the school that I wanted to most. It very sad to realize that something as trivial as money kept me from the quality of education I desired. \nI would also try to let younger self know how important it is to do work as it is assigned rather than waiting until it is due. This is another byproduct of my procrastination, and I learned this lesson the hard way. It was very hard to overcome the disservice done to me by my high school?s lenient policies regarding turning in late assignments and still receiving partial or even most of the credit, and this almost ruined me in college.",

So why am I enrolled for my fourth semester at seemingly podunk Hill Community College, two years after high school graduation? I didn't know when I was a senior that the economy would be taking a downward spiral into  rampant unemployment. Neither did I know that my dad would lose his job because of it. I didn't know that I would have to be working a fast food job to pay for my own education. If I could tell senior Kayla my best advice, it would be: Go to Hill College. That's where I can independently support my learning without delving too far into debt. And after this semester, I'm transferring to a university to be the English teacher I have always sought to be and to make the world at least a little bit better.

I did not have enough faith in their choices for me and chose against their will in some circumstances.  Second, would be to take my studies more seriously.  I did not know the importance of staying up to date with my due dates and taking notes in class.\nIf I took these two things more seriously my future would be much different.  \nI believe it would have helped to know these things in the beginning.

Depending on who you choose as an instructor, you can receive an effective educational experience that can help provide you leverage of obtaining a bachelor's degree.  The life of the Ybor City Campus is definitely worth the experience as you have the liberty to explore the city  while waiting for your next class schedule. If you are currently going through a financial situation, you have the opportunity to earn the Pell Grant without having to owe money back. Just make sure to be on top of your college courses as one slip up  can put you under a huge penalty. Overall the HCC helps students to maintain focus on their studies without any pressure of large size auditoriums with a large capacity crowd. Knocking out your required courses is an effective choice, so use HCC to your advantage on pursuing your bachelor's degree. "

While the campus may lack certain things such as a cafeteria or a nurse's office, we are lucky to be located near facilities that make up for these short comings. The school is near several clinics and an emergency center. There are also a lot of hole-in-the-wall restaurants and chain restaurants within a 4-mile radius.  HCC also has many events that enable the student to get involved with programs and clubs on campus (such as Collegiate 100). During some events, it provides information on how the student can better use HCC's amenities to further and better their education.\n\nI attend the Plant City campus at HCC, and it has single-handedly wiped away any fears I held about college. I was lucky enough to secure a work-study position in the student services center and I believe this to be one of the greatest decisions I've made here at this school. I've made so many friends and connections through my work that have helped me advance in my studies.  I also feel that for the first time, I'm learning something. During high school, I dual-enrolled with Polk State College. There, I felt as if I was retaining information just to regurgitate it and then soon forget it. At HCC, I am learning new material that builds and completes whatever I learned in high school. Even better, I can actually see myself applying these newfound skills and ideas in my day-to-day life.\n\nOverall, I would recommend HCC to anyone considering community college before university. The school provides many ways to succeed (or find your way, as we like to say) in your education, followed by your career. This review doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the absolute love and admiration I have for this school, it's opportunities, it's administration, it's faculty, and it's students. Even if I don't win a scholarship with this review, I 'm glad I got to share my feelings on this amazing school."

Many field trips sponsored by SGA which are free to the students, just pay a deposit to hold your spot and you will get your money back on the day of the event."

I feel extremely safe and comfortable around my fellow peers and professors. Everything that a college student is looking is right in your vicinity. Food, malls, grocery stores, and post offices are either on campus or 10 minutes away tops! I love how small the student to professor ratios are. Classes are well organized and can give you a challenge."

Many of the students that I have taken these classes with regularly engage in intellectual conversations both with the professors and among their peers. Students are encouraged to and often succeed at expanding their horizons; they learn how to be open-minded and look at the world through a new pair of glasses.

Small class sizes allow students to receive a personalized education for a more affordable than universities whose freshman and sophomore programs are likely inferior. Often, professors will distribute surveys to the students at the beginning of each semester so that they may cater their syllabus and assignments to the needs of each specific group of students. Over a two year period, I have been a full time student at HCC and have received over 60 credit hours. I found each one of the classes that I have taken to be exciting, fun, and interesting.

Like the time I drove my car without checking the water .Then I cracked my head gasket which took me forever to get fixed, this is a classic case of lesson learned. When people are giving you constructive advice it\u2019s for a reason they don't want you to suffer like they did. In high school is where you figure out your likes and dislikes.

Being a foolish minded young boy at the time I had no clue at the future ramifications of that single  decision .Now that I have decided to take back my educational future an attend college ,I would  have to tell myself work hardand dont give up.I had the wrong idea of what giving up was when I was younger now I understand a completly different meaning of what it takes to give everything . By just simply doing small minor adjustments to what I used to think was a big deal ,could have changed my whole future outcome .

Things will not always go my way and when that does happen I can either do one of a few things; complain, blame others and then give up or stop and think, allow it to be a lesson for me, and mature from it. The greatest thing that I learned from HCC is how to be a true leader. I can abuse the role of a leader by leading people astray, or I can honor that leadership role and be an influence to others.

I believe the best way to start college is with classes you have a true interest in, nothing to hard yet nothing that will put you to sleep. if you like your classes and teachers the whole transition is that much more easier, but that is not a promise. Most teachers will use a syllabus; it tells you when and what is due this wil prepare you for what is to come. use this to your advantage, it saves you time and let's you get ahead while staying prepared.

I still continue to live with some health challenges but college has allowed me to hope and offer others encourage, counsel, my time with a very willing heart to anyone who needs the  kind of encouragement I needed. College has been the place where I have found the will to live and change other people who may have stumbbled on hard times like I did.

Instead, i would advise myself that studying is the key to success.  I would reassure myself why I was in school to begin with, which is to learn. In time, i became so used to cramming everything that i learned that it had became a habit. I would advise myself to actually learn the material that i had studied, because more than likely I would see it again. Instead of having to re-learn everything i knew, it would be more like a review of prior studies.

I'm alittle older and I can tell you that it is better to finsh your education early while you are young then to waste the next couple of years working dead end jobs.  The workforce is extremely competative and if you have an education, employeers will look at you before anyone else.  There are much more opportunities for an educated person then for someone who has not finished school.  I have no regrets about not finishing school early, but If I could go back I would definetly take it seriously and finish at the top of my class.

I would say to make friends faster because it really is not that hard in this school. In my first semester, it would have been a life saver to know people in your classes.

After I graduated, It took me 2 years to get back in school. I am now in my fourth semester and I am doing great.  If I could go back in time though I would tell myself to get my mind off of boys and Into more books ! My advice to High School seniors... Especially the girls out there...Get a college education before you worry about anything else! Once you have your degree you will find a great job and then try to find a great life partner and have children, Until then you need to realize that after  you step out into the real world, you dont get help from family as much, you need to be able to take care of yourself..

I would make sure that the first credits I would enroll in would be all just transitional credits and not electives since I tended to change my major so much, so that I would not have taken any wasted credits. I also would have encouraged myself to research my professor's teaching style before I enrolled in the class so that I would never have to drop or add any classes.

I thought that I wouldn't have any friends since the friends I had in high school dropped me once my son was born. After my first semester, I realized that my life was perfect. I would go back to my senior self and tell myself to relax! I would make friends just fine, and community college would be a great place to start out.

I now realize that if i would've pushed myself harder i would have prepared myself for what lied ahead of me in my near and distant future. I now realize that the easy way is not always the best  way in the long run. I would have told myself to not drop out of any of my classes when i get in college.

I would also tell myself to apply for college much earlier in the beginning of my senior year so I could have a better chance of getting in.  Since I did not do these things, I am okay with that.

I'm cognizant of norms, but I choose to be independent and non-reliant on others.  I do wish I had the experience of having a group of friends.

Another advice I would give myself would be to get more involved in school activities and clubs.  I would tell myself that because they are a way to meet new people.

You don't have to read that chapter that you were assigned, but if you don't you're only hurting yourself. If you make sure to get yourself together, sit down and do the work- you could potentially learn more in  one semester than you did in your entire high school career.

Students at community college tend to be  more focus in their studies compared to students from universities because we have no sororities, and most of them dont have football teams. Therefore, distraction of parties are not problem in community college. In a community college, everybody has drastic different goals and different paths of careers. There are people that want to transfer, and others that don't. At an universities, even though you have students with different majors, there are still things that unite people such as partying because of sorority  or football games.",

Many universities coexist in the immediate vicinity as HCC, so many HCC students consider themselves to be \"leftovers.\" These notions are false. While HCC may be the last choice on the lists of certain students when they consider which institution they would like to attend, choosing HCC to begin one's academic career is an excellent choice to make. Hillsborough Community College is home to more than five campuses and a wide array of services available to its students. HCC has affordable student housing, an immense virtual library, and a wide array of academic programs for students to choose from. HCC is home to one of the best Honors Colleges in the country, and harbors an international program that not only sends students abroad for their studies, but actively seeks out international students to receive their education from this institution. HCC educates students from more than 130 countries, giving all of its students a unique and high quality educational experience."

                "Dane": "I'm sure I don't need to say again that about three-quarters of Hillsdale students are Conservative Republicans and Christians. They come from fairly wealthy families, hence the college's large endowment despite no federal aid. From what I've seen, they are definitely NOT snooty, though they are notoriously well-dressed! \nQuite a few international students, though most of them are white, too. Compared to in the 70s when there were probably about a hundred blacks and a dozen Asians (I did some research), the campus is pretty homogeneous at this point in time, but it is purely coincidence. Race is definitely not a big factor here. Everyone can feel comfortable, and this is reinforced. The college was accepting blacks 20 years before slavery was abolished, for crying out loud!"

            "Here's your chance: Say anything about your college! ": {
                "Dane": "Here it is: Many students check into Hillsdale and, because they've never been made to fathom the concept of a college ruled by SERIOUS students (not just brainless jocks) and the ideals of our nation's Founders...well, Hillsdale is a very sad, lonely place for them. MAKE SURE you have done your research. This is no diploma mill. There are big things in store at Hillsdale, and it has no time to waste on the \"average\" student.\n\nHOWEVER, I hope this is not an issue for you. To the shock of my colleagues and (most of) my family, I turned my back on the Ivy League to attend this institution. The college demands but two things: a love of all values good and American that Harvard, Yale, etc sell out for the almighty federal dollar......and a total willingness to learn these values and live them. Good luck."
            },
            "Is the stereotype of students at your school accurate? ": {
                "Dane": "Yes and no. There are quite a few former homeschooled students, more than your average student body. Also, despite having ditched the religious affiliation of its founders LONG ago, Hillsdale is swamped in Christian students due to, again, its strong Conservative leanings. But on the other hand, you will find no witch hunts on campus; there are still many Democrats and atheists (and even a couple gays) and everyone is fairly accepting of each other."
            },
            "What are the academics like at your school? ": {
                "Dane": "Hillsdale's education is 100% geared at learning for its own sake, and NOT job certification. This is no secret; it is even in the Mission Statement. The average class size is about 12 so you should be fairly involved in the discussion, and as enthusiastic as some of these kids are, you'll stick out like a sore thumb if you're not. Take that as you will. The professors, while incredibly smart, are always willing to chat (even over lunch!). In layman's terms, they keep it real.\nThe politics, econ, and history departments are strong. If you plan on those fields, prepare to someday rock the world (also in layman's terms)."
            },
            "What are the most popular student activities/groups?  ": {
                "Dane": "Pretty decent. The Student Federation always has something fun planned. Greek is pretty big (about 40% of students). The party scene is small, but it's there. If you're not fond of the party scene, there are still jocks and frat boys who do the majority of the drinking and rough-housing (and many get themselves kicked out, thank God). If you are serious about this school (and you better be), you will usually be studying most nights and trying to catch up on sleep other nights. \nIf you REALLY need to escape campus, there are stores, restaurants, a movie theater, a bowling alley, etc not 2 miles away. No big deal."
            },
            "What is the stereotype of students at your school? ": {
                "Dane": "1.) HOMESCHOOLERS 2.) Totally 100% clean-cut Conservative Republican and/or Christian. That's to be expected, since the college was founded on very patriotic principles of limited government, so of course it would appear to attract students of the same mindset."
            },
            "What is your overall opinion of this school? ": {
                "Dane": "Hillsdale is very politically-minded, with its famous sponsored speaking events, publications, and Washington/International internships. And there ARE a lot of each. This should be no one's back-up school; only come here if you are 100% devoted to some DEEP political/historical insight. Though the math and science departments are pretty good, a desire to get into politics or economics will carry you far; Hillsdale is virtually a pipeline to Washington D.C., and very popular among Conservative circles. If you're going to include Hillsdale College on your resume, though, you'd better hope it's not a Democrat reading it!\n\nThe administration is very helpful and nice. Dr. Arnn started in 2000 and very quickly helped the college get back on its feet after a pretty ugly incident here involving the past President. No one who commands your education is shy about discussing it with you. Get to know them.\n\nThe college, in my opinion, is a little too small in both student body and campus size, though this may be because I come from a small high school in a small town and was ready for a change. In contrast, if you hail from a HUGE high school, you might really appreciate the closeness experienced on campus.\n\nHillsdale, Michigan is about 10,000 people, but the town/townies are pretty indifferent about the college/students (must be the economy) unless there's a big event or guest speaker. It is not common to visit downtown which is a shame because Hillsdale, being the county seat, has some large and beautiful historic buildings. Classy storefronts and churches are not hard to find either. Take a walk around early in the year, because the rest of the time you'll most likely be too busy!\n\nSchool pride...There are students who understand the significance of this place, and there are those that don't. I really can't say much more than that."

                "Madeline": "If I could visit myself as a high school senior, I would tell myself to be fearless as I moved on to college.  It took me a long time to feel comfortable so far from home, and I squandered a lot of opportunities to become more involved on campus.  I could explain firsthand how lonely it is when you do nothing and meet no one.  I would tell myself to try out for the play, to take swing dancing lessons, to join student government, and to start saying \u201cyes\u201d where I would normally say \u201cno\u201d.  I know the transition into college life can be difficult, but why not make the most of it? I should be involved in the things I love to do, so I can meet people with the same interests and passions.  Those people will become my life-long friends.  I know I struggle with not knowing what to expect\u2014with not being firmly in control of a situation\u2014but I should not fight what I cannot change.  After all, \u2018you never know until you try\u2019, and I might just end up surprising myself.",

There is always a small class size, so the teacher as time to help each student learn.  I am from Los Angeles, so the most shocking and wonderful thing about the school for me is the respect which everyone gives and recieves.  Holding doors open for others and saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" are second nature.  You can even leave your backpack or laptop somewhere, and return to find it untouched."

                "Comment": "Hillsdale is a great place to go if you're looking for an affordable liberal arts college where you are free to study many things before choosing your major. The faculty and academics are unmatched, and campus culture is very friendly and welcoming. However, this is not a good college to go to if you are LGBT+, disabled, neurodivergent, or even politically liberal. While the students and faculty are generally openminded and willing to listen to diverse opinions, the administration is controlled by conservative donors, and students can be punished for everything from extramarital sex to dressing in a way that's considered atypical for their gender. Many students have a great experience at Hillsdale, but it's because they never run into the harsh consequences for breaking the norm that await between the lines of the Honor Code and in the deans' offices. There is also no sexual assault policy or prevention education on campus, leaving women vulnerable to great harm should something happen to them. So while I will always have a great love for the students I met at Hillsdale and the wonderful professors who helped me become who I am during my time as a student, I cannot say that I would send my son or daughter there until significant reforms are made."

Hinds has done nothing but open up opportunities for me and made me become a better person. They were an all-around college. Yes, education came first and was very important but also the college focused on making sure you as a person enjoyed the college experience to the best. Going to a university from Hinds has been an easy transition because Hinds a truly prepared me to be that better person. Hinds literally is one big family. That is something that they say when you come to visit the college. You will get attached to that family love. Every administrator, dean, staff member, and teacher have a loyal heart to Hinds. They are all both passionate and sincere for each student that comes through Hinds. Students came first in every teacher and staff member\u2019s eyes. They improvised to challenge every student\u2019 s minds and their new way of thinking. The access to so many resources was phenomenal. The writing center and the math labs were the main attraction for student resources. Teachers were in the labs getting you one on one help every day. Getting involved on campus was a must. There was literally a student organization for every person\u2019s interest. Hinds has over 150 student organizations and if you couldn\u2019t find something you were interested in, then make your own organization. The atmosphere and love of the college is so big and I can truly say I really honestly miss Hinds and the family love they shared."

Though the years seem to go by extremely quickly, it is immensly important to take your time and live life \"in the moment\". Times come and go. Before you know what is going on, it is over. If you don't take the time to enjoy your time, then you only miss out on the great things and opportunities of the here-and-now. Tomorrow is not promised. Though you shouldn't forego planning, you cannot possibly plan for everything. Take the ups and downs as they come and learn to go with that ebb and flow. \n\nAnother quick word I would pass along to myself would be to learn to be social and to open up to people. You need relationships with person(s) you can trust to help you through the low parts of life and to share the high moments with. Without those relationships, life become much more difficult.

Before college, parents assume the dominant role in organization, preparation, and focus.  Students go from this \"sheltered\" existence, to a somewhat overwhelming independence.  Freedom from \"shelter\" can be dangerous if not planned for.  Colleges expect an adult to arrive on campus,prepared for the flood of responsibilities, activities and enticements.  Some students transitioning from this sheltered environment to college might greatly benefit from a transitional \"class\" offered in high school.  Great time is spent on academic preparation and college entrance testing, but none is spent on preparation for \"college life.\"   The first semester of college should be scaled back to the basics to allow for this transition.  Minimizing other activities for first semester freshmen such as Greek Life should not be optional until second semester so that good study habits and class attendance can be the primary focus.

Also aside from the financial aid aspect, I would encourage myself to be more driven and hard working. Since I've been in college, I've learned these important  characteristics the hard way but now that I have them, they will never be taken away because I understand now that this is my future life that I'm working towards and if I don't take advantage of the opportunities at hand then I can't blame anyone but myself.",

Deciding a major based on annual income is the worst thing you can do to yourself. Money can not buy happiness.  I would also tell myself that getting involved with extracurricular activities is one of the best choices you can make. Being involved with a sport or club gets you motivated and pushes you to want to succeed in all curricular fields.  College by no means is a breeze so you must work hard, stay determined, make friends(because chances are that they'll last a lifetime), and laugh as much as possible.

Do not let others around you that make bad choices influence you.  You are in College to pursue an education and earn a degree, not to just have fun. Do your best and earn the highest grades you can, but at the same time weigh your time. Studying is not the most important thing in life during college.

I probably would tell myself not to stress over the little things that really don't matter.  God will always get me through everything.  I know I would tell myself to be on the computer EVERYDAY on this website trying to get more scholarships!  My mom always told me I should've done that, but I didn't listen.

Keep your spiritual life strong by attending church and church activities regularly, praying, and serving others.  Finally, do not try to take short cuts.

The best part part of Hiram is indubitably the people, followed by the out reach and exploratory options available.  The professors are knowledgeable and easily reachable and want to build strong, amiable relations  with students and the personal are friendly and generally efficient.  Student-wise, there is a fair range of of people and interests, thus making it likely that if you get involved in anything, there are people that you will connect.  The drawback is more centered on the emphasis that is being given to the STEM programs at the expense of the arts, thus a bit of undermining the liberal arts title and history of the institution; while the facilities of the college are not bad, neither are they cutting edge, serviceable and well-kept.  It should be noted that the small size of the college means that there are fewer options available maybe, but this is offset by the vigorous emphasis and aid provided to get involved beyond the college whether interning, jobs, study-abroad, or others of a similar vein.

College is meant to be an experience. If I knew then what I know now about life and getting a career, I would tell myself to do more extracurricular activities, take different classes outside of my major and just have more fun.  Once you graduate from college and start looking for a job, your prospective employer doesn't ask for your grade that you received in physics in your freshman year in college. All that they care about is if you have a degree and from where and if you are a well rounded and interesting person who is intelligent enough to figure out the job that you are appying for.  A good college experience can lead you to being that well rounded and very employable person.",
                "Marquita": "I would tell myself that the studying and dedication doesn't stop here. Yes, you are going to graduate, but its just the beginning after graduation. College is not all about partying, drinking and football games like the movies say. You must work hard. However its not just all work and no play. It is possible to balance out the two and still have fun in school. There will be times when you just want to give up and quit school because it gets tough. But don't give up! Four to five years later when you have your degree and your making your money, you will be so happy that you didn't give up.

Take the extra babysitting job in the summer, save the money to pay for housing and books. Live on campus, find a mentor and become obsessed with the library. You can make something more of yourself, you do have an option, and they\u2019re not willing to give it to you so you have to take it! \nSincerely,\nJes - from your future, with a future",

I have learned patience and the realization that everyone learns in a different way through my two years as a Teaching Assistant, Peer Mentor and as an Orientation Leader. I have learned organization and communication skills through my work as Student Body President. I have also learned leadership and public relations work by being Co-Chair of Hiram's first annual Relay for Life.  By going to Hiram I have seen that the world is a much different place than the community that I grew up in. I have met so many wonderful people who have taught me their values, cultures, and ways of life and although I have some problems with Hiram, I am not sure I would have gotten the same experience that I have received at a different college or university.",

Aswell as friends I have been guided with very skilled and helpfull staff like my English Teacher John Liffiton and my cultural communicatio professor Annaliese Harper and Graphic Arts teacher Patrick Burk.  It is overall a unique experience that everyone should have the opportunity of having it and that unfortunately for financial reasons are not given this chance.",
                "jessica ": "I have only been at Hiram since August but already I have learned a lot.  I have gotten a lot of one on one attention from my professors . I have learned how to be more independant with a little help from the faculty staff ,much to my mommy and daddys dismay.  I think that Hiram has helped me realize my dream of higher education from which I will go on to get my masters and then ph.d   I thought I wanted to attend a bigger school,  but I am so glad I chose the small rural college I attend.",
                "Teresa ": "I have learned a lot about how I learn best and what academic subjects interest me the most. I have also been exposed to opportunities and people that I would not have been otherwise.  The professors and classes at Hiram are awesome and capture my attention.  The campus activities and clubs are  very active and always consist of fun ways to get to know other students. The campus is beautiful and feels like home. It has been valuable for me to attend because not only are the academics wonderful, but the people are amazing too. It has also been valuable for me to grow up, live on my own and be exposed to new experiences. The most valuable part of being in college is that I have learned that taking risks is okay and have tried many new things as a result of that.",
                "Ashley ": "I am a freshman at Hiram,  but I have done post- secondary education classes at Kent State University during my high school education.  The college experiences that I have had taught me responsibilty. Besides responsibilty, it has given me the opportunity to want  more; it gave me reassurance to my goals and gave me the ability to have higher ambitions. It is so critical to attend college. Reason being is, not only does that shiny diploma on the wall say \"you successfully received more education\", one gets to become passionate. Not in one subject necessarily, but in many.  There are so many new things to become  more passionate about , and college lets  people discover those in more ways than imaginable. Once a person gets passionate about something, they  will become more ambitious and will dream of being  something great. High school gives a person the foundation of dreams, but college gives the person everything else to build those dreams.",
                "Justin ": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior, I would have more than enough to talk about. The first discussion I would bring up is that critical thinking is one of the most important tools in decision making. There were so many times I would act on impulse when making decision and it was not the best policy. I believe that in conjunction with not taking every single thing so seriously are important tools to having a good senior year. Being a high school graduate, I sometimes look back at all the drama that I did not have the ability to overlook. Being in college if the same situations happened to me again, I would either handle them differently, or just brush them off.  The last topic I would try to cover is not burning too many bridges. Just because I was leaving for college, does not mean that I needed to be closed off from the people \"I thought\" I was not going to keep in touch with. In all honestly, those people I closed off, are the ones I find myself going to for guidance.",
                "Zach ": "Looking back, I have to say that there really isn't much that I wasn't prepared for in the jump to college life. The only piece of advice that I would have to give myself in Highschool that I know of now is to apply to far more scholarships than I did, given that now I am facing bills I am unable to pay without extra financial support. Other than a higher degree of scholarship hunting, I would simply confirm a lot of suspicions I had about campus life so that move in day wouldn't be quite so nerve-racking.",
                "Tessianna ": "I would tell myself not to keep myself so sheltered. THe biggest mistake I made was keeping to myself and not getting out and meeting new people my first year. I missed out on a lot of fun people and fun times because I spent all my time doing homework or waiting to talk to my boyfriend from home online. If I could do my first year all over again I waould go to more campus events and open up more to people in order to make more friends. This is exactly what I have done this year and Ive never had so much fun. I have met amazing people and I have fun along with staying focused on my school work. I have the best of both worlds.",
                "Christopher ": "Make a list of your college choices with \"Pros\" and \"Cons\",  including location, tuition, consider the scholarship opportunities,  discuss the money you or your parents will owe or pay and go on an overnite stay to get a feel for the atmosphere; don't follow your girl or your friends.  College is about new experiences and adapting to a different environment than what you are used to.  Watch my 3 minute video posted on Facebook on what to bring to college.  \nThank you for any consideration to provide me a scholarship.\n   \nhttp://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=550019904148\n\nChristopher Sabo\nJunior, Hiram College\nHiram, Ohio",
                "Kristen ": "My advice to students and parents looking for the right college would be to actually go on campus visits, they are the best way of making sure the college has the right \"fit\".  While you are on these visits, talk to some of the students, ask them for their honest opinion of their college.  Also, find a helpfull staff member and ask them why they think their institution is a great place to learn.  I would even suggest going on overnight visits to the campus, a campus can be one way on a visit day, but you see its true colors when you stay a couple of days.  My final word of advice is to make sure that you feel comfortable when you first arrive on campus.  Try to imagine yourself going to the school, sitting a classroom full of students, does it feel right? If it does, chances are, you are in the right place!",
                "Kristina ": "To find the right college, it would be in best interest to go with what feels comfortable.  If a college that is part of the selection group does not feel right for you, or your child, then it most likely is not a place that will bring success.  It is almost cliche to say that people go with what they know, but when it comes to spending a lot of your money and time to receive higher education, going with what you know would be best.  Also keep in mind what features you want out of the college, and the college experience.  Making the most of a college experience would include extracurricular activities that would be of interest to you but would also benefit you in the future.  By choosing to do certain activities and extracurriculars you can really expand and broaden your life experience.  These activities, extracurriculars, and campus events can really have an impact on the social network, and future career network,  for your life in and after college.  Becoming involved on campus is the most beneficial thing that any person will ever have the chance to do in life, and I would take advantage.",

                "Cortney ": "The best advice I could give about making the right choice is to choose a school based on what's the right fit for you.  I feel the biggest mistakes some of my friends have made is going to a school purely because it is where their boyfriend/girlfriend/parents. went to college.  The choice you make now is going to affect you for the next four (or more) years, not your parents or your friends.  If it is the wrong choice, it will make everything about the transition to college more difficult.  In order to make the most of the experience, besides making sure you are somewhere that you feel comfortable,  be certain that you do not shut yourself off from the other students.  Make friends with the people on your dorm floor early.  Don't go home the first few weekends, even you are homesick, because this is the time that bonds are made and you are able to really get to know people without the stress of a classroom.  Be sure to focus on classwork, too.  As tempting as it is to just have fun, education is the main reason for college and freshman year is crucial.",

                "morgan ": "To find one's right collegiate fit, one must always apply to his dream college. Even if it seems financially out of reach, or that you would be unfit for it in some way, it always is possible, and can help you measure yourself. I applied to a variety of schools, and actively tried to give each an equal chance--to rule out nothing. Consideration of every aspect helpd me too, I would never go to a college for just one aspect of it. The main thing is to consider where you would feel comfortible, and not to be distracted too much by what you think you want to do in the future. I don't want to short circuit myself, or miss out on potential opportunity. Changing your mind is alright! To make the most out of college, I almost use my professors.  They are the people you are going to get most of your professional skills from. Possessing a love of learning is another key thing. You can't skim by, so put your all into it!",
                "Alyssa ": "I think the key in choosing the right college is visiting the campus and learning as much as possible about student life while there. Many schools, such as Hiram, do offer overnight programs for prospective students that allow them to stay with a current student on campus for one night and attend several classes and school functions while there. I attended one of these programs at Hiram while I was choosing a school, and it made me see that I could really picture myself attending this school.\nOnce you have chosen a school, it is necessary to always put your education first. It is great to be involved in extra curricular activities, but it is important to remember that you are there to get an education, not to make as many friends as possible or to be the president of everything. College is meant to give us the knowledge neccessary to be successful in the real world, and this means that sometimes you have to make sacrifices in order to keep that process going. Your education is not worth losing for a few nights of partying.",
                "Claire ": "Visit the campuses and choose a place where you will feel comfotable, happy, and safe.",
                "Kim ": "The best advice I can give is follow your instincts. I was always told, \"When you get to the campus, you will know if it's right for you or not.\" It is completely true. When I walked onto the campus of Hiram College I said to myself, \"This is it. I'm done looking, I have found my college.\" It was the only college I applied to and it has been the only place I have ever wanted to be.\nYour college also has to be a place where you can see yourself being happy for the entire time you are there. For example, if you are an athlete and you get hurt and cannot play again, will you still be happy with the school?\nFinding a school you love really makes your college experience. When you love it, you are more likely to get involved, make friends, do well in class, and enjoy yourself in general.\nAll in all, don't go somewhere you have qualms about. If it requires twenty-five college visits to find YOUR college, do it. It is worth every mile you drive when you finally find the one.",
                "Chanel ": "I think the best advice I would give to parents and students is when searching for the right college, do a lot of research on the college especially in the area you wish to major in. Make sure the college has A+ programs.  Don't just pick a college to go to because all of your friends went there.  To have a wonderful college experience you have to have courage to step outside of your comfort zone and explore the possibilities. Take chances. You'll probably make mistakes but that is part of the learning college experience.  Study abroad if you can afford it. Lastly, don't be afraid to make new friends. Its not like you are getting rid of your old friends for new ones you are just building more bonds with people who have similar goals as you.",
                "Deena ": "In finding the right college, my advice would be to figure out what you as a student want to take away from the college experience in the end, other than a degree.   Parents: encourage your child to research a variety of schools before making a final decision.  Take visits and tour the campuses.  Take advantage of over-night stays so your child can actually live a night and day as a college student before hand to see if they like a certain school's environment.  Students should always have a back-up plan and know alternative routes for the selection process.  College is about the experiences.  Make sure you find a place that fits your personality and learning environment.  Once you find a school that holds your interest in both areas, you will be sure to succeed.",
                "Lindsey ": "Every student has all the potential for making the most of their college experience at their fingertips. You don?t even have to know what you want (though it helps). Just be passionate in what you do. Find a college that will do its best to foster your growth and then work hard at whatever you put your mind to. I recommend making a list prioritizing the characteristics that you seek in a school, such as strong departments in your field of interest, rank, size, location, facilities, and study abroad programs. Then search for schools meeting your criteria online. Once you narrow down your options, try to visit the schools. Visiting is crucial to ascertaining the true atmosphere of the college and its community. Finally, apply to your top colleges and strive to get the scholarships that will allow you to go. Even if you can?t afford your top choice, your second choice isn?t going to hinder your potential. Once you are at college get involved and be open-minded. Explore your possibilities and keep an eye open for opportunities. Most of all, don?t sell yourself short. Anything is possible, despite what the whole world might say.",
                "Bridgette ": "I think the most important thing might be not to stress that you have to get it right the first time around. If you truly do not like a school it is possible to transfer. Get involved, make friends, and have an open mind, it sounds cliche, but it really is the best way to have an awesome time during your four (or more) years in college.",

Enjoy these four year because you have the chance to learn almost anything you want  and it shouldn't be wasted! Good Luck",
                "Ryan ": "The key to finding the right college is being proactive. There are so many good choices out there but the key to finding the perfect fit is visiting, staying overnight, and sitting in on a class.  The first step is to find out what characteristics are essential for you to succeed in that environment. Rather it be small classes, available study areas, or tutors, the key is to find out what you need to be the best you can be for the next four years. The second thing to do is the look at what schools fit you academic interests. Not all schools offer the same things and a particular school may not have a major that you are looking for.  After slimming the selection down the next thing to do is to start visiting. Find out from students who attend the school what things they don?t enjoy about it. Will any of these things become problems for you? This, as well as sitting in on a particular class of interest, and staying overnight to get a true sense of campus life will all aid immensely in finding what is best for you.",
                "Jazmine ": "When you go on the tour or if you stay the night, ask your tourguide or host to tell you the truth. Ask them what they really think of the school. Are the dorms and food really as nice as what you're shown during the tour? How helpful are the profs? What do kids do in their free time (the real deal, if they drink, you need to know)?  Is it hard to get into the classes you need? Is the school good enough for your major? Was this school their first choice? If not, what's the difference between this school and their first choice? If they got into their first choice, did they just come here because of the money? Knowing what they know now, in whatever year of college they are in, what would they do differently? Knowing what they know now about their college would they still apply. If you're positive you're going to go to that school, ask them what dorm you should live in and what profs are the best to take classes from. And ask them to be honest. They are no help if they're not.",
                "Jennifer ": "The greatest advice is go where you want for the right reasons.  Don't go because your friends are going or your boy/girl friend.  Decide what is important to you: like do you want to be close or far away from home, do sports play a big role in your life, what is your interests in study.  Don't go to a college that doesn't have the degree you want.  Do whats right for you, research the schools you are interested in and see what they offer and learn about the requirements and activities.  You can get involved and plan ahead before you even start attending college.  Back in high school, I researched Hiram and found out what the core requirements were for graduation and what was expected of the accounting major.  I also found out all the sports and activities, along with the heads of the accounting department to contact them.  I did my research and couldn't be happier.  It was right for me and it could help for you too!",
                "Camille ": "The best way to find the right college is to visit, after doing your research and usually applying first. Overnight stays are the single best kind of visit to really know if a college is right for you. When I was deciding on my colleges, it was the \"vibe\" I got from the tours that pointed me decidedly in the right direction. I knew for certain that I wouldn't be happy at one and that I'd be perfectly comfortable at the other.",
                "Stephanie ": "If I had to give advice, the most important thing I would say is to first decide what size school you would like to attend. Once you know that, you will have an idea about what types of schools to look at. If your not sure, start by visiting a small, medium and large school.  After deciding definitly visit your prospective schools, you will never know what a school is really like until you visit it in person. Many schools offer over night visits, so taking advantage of the over night stays is an excellent way to get to know student life, with out the sugar coating of administrators.  Once you choose a school you need to make the most of your experience. I can not express enough how important it is it get involved. You will always have time for a club, a sport or some other organization. It is a great way to get to know people and who doesn't want to make as many friends as possible?

The volleyball team was great and the students were always there to support the athletic program. Most of the teachers cared about pour success and were there for us in and out of the classroom, no matter what the issues was. The dorms were on of the main reasons I moved off campus after my Freshman year. Not only were the floors falling apart in the rooms, there was black mold coming through the walls, crawling up the bathroom showers, and stink bugs completely infested the place. After many arguments with the president and the board, nothing was changed. A few days ago we were all informed that the college would be closing their doors officially in May. As we all struggle to understand what caused the president of our school to embezzle of 70 thousand dollars, we keep fighting as a student body to find new colleges together. For these reasons Hiwassee College is one of the best and worst schools I could ever attend. "

This new president is out to destroy the environment and therefore everything this school once stood for. Whether or not you look from a moral or economic perspective, this college is under poor administration and should be avoided at all cost. Because ultimately, the cost will be at your own expense."

                "Comment": "Hocking College is a great school that is victim of a horrible college president. President Betty Young has been president of the college for just over two years now. She has done very little to improve student life, let alone academic options. Several programs have been either stripped, or cut down to the bare minimum requirements to still be an applicable college major. This is specifically about a the Equine programs that the school offers. However, this also applies to the Art Design and Marketing program. The program was stripped down to the bare minimum so that the current class could graduate. Then the program will be cut. Also, there are no cameras in the school parking lots. You have to pay for a parking pass, and get no secure peace of mind. Third, within the last three years, the school managed to acquire funding for a football team. The idea may look good on paper, but Hocking has managed to bring the worst crowds of students to their campus using the football team. Ever since their arrival, we've been victim to sexual harassment and assault, increased drug and alcohol activity, and increased filth within the residence halls. This is not because of the demographic. This is because the players have a lack of respect for the campus staff and fellow students. They refuse to exercise personal hygiene for the most part. Fourth, the Hocking College Meal Plan is severely overpriced. You pay more than it's worth for the amount of food you can get. Fifth, the college seems to act like they have to pull teeth to help a student in financial need. \n\nOn the plus side, the Residence Hall staff, Cafeteria staff, and Campus Safety staff are very friendly. They do what they can to make sure the student comes first. Professors very good about replying to students as soon as they can. Classes are very hands on, rather than large capacity lectures as seen on movies and TV shows. It has a very home-y atmosphere if you can get past the townsfolk of Nelsonville.\n\nPros:\nNice Staff\nLaid Back Atmosphere\nHands On\nProfessional and Caring Instructors\n\nCons:\nFootball Team\nCollege President cutting programs\nExpensive Meal Plan\nNo Parking Lot Security\nAlmost refuses to help students in financial need."

Most of the faculty are not there to help you (with very few exceptions), and more interested in the money. Some teachers have quit in the past due to the fact the students aren't being treated well and their needs aren't being met. I would advise not to go to this school because some of the programs are getting worse and the current President is only putting money into things that make more money and don't know what to do with it. Also, the water makes you sick. There was recently a boil order."

                "Comment": "This place does not care about you flat out. This is my second semester here and I have had a below content experience. It is extremly obvious the college is going under because staff is being fired constantly and part time teachers are being hired. The part time teachers do not care most of the time and just give you A's and B's for completing your work. The food here is absolutely atrocious and sometimes I can barely stomach it and end up eating nothing that day. (The dining hall also closes at 4pm on weekends so good luck eating on weekends if you stay on campus. The worst part about this place is the fact that I feel as if they are just trying to take my money and they do not care about my well being or education at all. If you have no other choice but to go here I recommend commuting so you can save yourself from giving them an extra 12,000 dollars for horrible food, and a bad experience.  The only good thing about this place is some of the people are cool if you can put up with getting to know all the gang bangers that roam the hall constantly just failing classes and leaving the next semester. This college in all honesty is horrible and I regret leaving Columbus State and I hope Betty White (the President) loses her job so someone that actually cares about students can be in charge. "

Thus, when I was in high school in my country Mali in West Africa, my dream was to come to the USA and study Finance or Economics in order to work for international organization such World Bank or IMF (International Money Fund). In addition, in high school I was good in math and sciences, but I didn\u2019t learn or study very well languages such as English, French, and German as I was supposed to. As a result, now I have took two semesters to study and learn English before I can start taking academic classes in next spring semester 2014. Therefore, knowing what I know now about college life, if I could go back and make transition the advice I would give myself would be to study always seriously no matter what major is. I should always mind to get good or excellent grade in any courses related to the major I am studying, whether I like the courses or not.",

Also,  spend more time with the other college students.  There are lots of people out there who could turn out to make very good friends, so make some time to socialize outside the classroom halls and cafeteria.

There were situations that arose in my nursing career where I had to be able to confidently juggle multiple emergency situations on my own.  Because of the instruction that I had, I was able to do my job efficienly and provide the very best care that my patients deserved.  Having had such a positive experience at Hocking, I am left with a thirst for further knowledge, and a desire to do more with my career.

Take the time and take in the extra knowlege, education is not a race.  While your gathering grains of knowledge,  ask as many questions as your heart desires.  Never assume or believe that you know exactly what will interest or call you; in five, ten...or even twenty to thirty years from now.   Inhale what knowledge is availible.  Don't pick and choose what would be quickest or simplest.  Do not select your educational career based solely on what you find engaging and interesting at the time.  Fan out, widen your scope...an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  That class you didn't take because you knew you would hate it, could contain that one kernel that helps orient you and put you a little ahead later.  Be a sponge and absorb, you don't always know what's best.  Better a sponge than a brick that simply drops where ever interests and agendas lie at the time.

Third, I would tell myself that my interactions with my peers and my articulation would do no less than expand my networking capabilities.

In college you are the only one who is responsible for your grades, attending classes, and other responsibilities you have you have to take care of. Unlike like high school, there is no safety net to catch you when you mess up in college. The school and teachers don't care if you attend classes or not, its either you want to be there are not. There will be nobody there to tell you to get to class, and do homework and class work. , Also become more organized. Take notes in class, know when assignments are do, ask questions and know all-important dates. Something simple as not turning in a homework assignment can cause you to fail the class.

They require all of a student's personal time if they are working. Professors are strict and uncompromising when it comes to quality of work. This is in my opinion, why the college's graduation rates are less than stunning. People associate programs catered to the adult learner with easy or forgiving. Once they are in the program they find out it is the real deal and squirm their way out under intense pressure. Probably something that will need to be addressed in the future.",

In my Criminal Justice class, i had a wonderful professors and helped me to figure out things that i needed an answer. The academic requirement is good because you have to work hard to get it and there is an entrance test you have to write before you can be admitted. The entrance test have a grade they look for and when you fail to make the grade you will keep on taking the test until you pass it. The University is accredited and getting a job will not be as major problem, but at the same time it depends on the student seriousness."

The mix of education is liberal arts with specialization in chosen field. One learns to become a better writer, presenter, and critical thinker in addition to learning specific skills.",
                "Joe": "I think the best thing about the University is that almost everyone is friendly and helpful when it comes to Academics. But they lack the neccessary resources to make the college one of its kind. The library is small, the computer lab is not open 24hrs, internship opportunities is not robust. The University is too small to actually boast of amenities like gym, housing facilities, recreational and sporting as well as rankings. When it come to administration, they extremely helpful and will go the extra mile to assist you in academic affairs. What i can say make the university stand out among other Universities in the state of Florida is how it has been structured. One can take classes in school, online, in the day, evening and on weekends. That make it unique and gives an opportunity for everyone to earn a degree without leaving his current job. Helpful staff will always be part of me and helpful professors as well.\nWell, most students complain of the cost to attend the University and i think is because it is a private university."

I would ask myself to do the necessary research in the career-choosing process.  Knowing that my high school senior self wanted to help others, but did not necessarily take the time to think outside of the box in regards to careers helping others, I would say:\n\nYou have always done well in school, taking the time to do the work required.  You always transitioned into learning environments well.  Your college life problems will not revolve around your studies.  It will involve choosing your future, your career.  Truly take the time to study majors, to review all careers that help others, from teaching to therapists.  Do not bounce around, \"trying\" different majors to find the career for you.  It will waste your time, leaving you frustrated.  Research now, and not just through traditional research.  Talk to people, step into unknown territory.  By stepping outside of your comfort zone, you will find what you are meant to do.  Be brave, branch out.  You will be surprised, but you will be happy.",

Listen to your parents, because they have been through many of the heartaches you are about to go through, and they are only trying to protect you from the same heartache.  As hard as it will be when it comes to love listen with you head not your heart, it is the only way to be safe and make the right decision in this area.  Get an education no matter what else you do in life.  The mind is a muscle that needs to be exercised and often.  There is much to learn about the world and what it has to offer, travel, explore, and enjoy those around you.  Your family and friends will always be the most important people in the world, never turn your back on them, or let them down.  God is you lifeline, and maker and through Him your life is complete.  He will take care of you and your family and friends every needs.  It will all fall into place, so be patient.",

Second thing I would say is, continue to stay positive no matter what is going in life.",

Talk to the consuelors at the college since the have a better idea of what you need to enroll. Also, I would be cautious of the grades that your getting throughout the year because those last points reallly go towards your GPA.

When you decide to go back to school it's tough with a full- time job and family. Your family will be supportive but that doesn't make things any easier on you.

I would tell myself to stick to the dream about becoming a Marine Biologist at the university that I had chosen and not to listen to my friends that I would be leaving them behind as they left me behind. I would also say how difficult and taxing it is to attend college while being a singe parent without support from anyone. Your dream will be put on hold so that you can get educated in something that will make money to barely support the two of you, but not in a field that you will love.  That you will struggle with making money to pay for everything needed and finding time spending time with your son will be hard as well.

I would tell myself to go straight to university instead of community college because since i have been in community college i have been slacking off. Community college does not seem to have any value to me. Figuring out what you want to major in is probably the hardest thing to igure out, but eventually you will find it and stick with it. I realized that i want to be an english teacher as well as be a photojournalist and i did not realize this until a few months ago. So, i would also tell myself to not stress about what i want to be, just let the career come to you. I would also have to say focus a lot on your studies and try to have free time but not enough to slack off and loose interest in school. Lastly, i would tell myself to have as much fun as possible during the summer.",

The decisions you make right now will effect your life forever. Learn to become a leader. Leadership is \"the process of influencing the activities of an organized group toward achievement.\" (Rouch & Behling, 1985, p.46). By obtaining leadership you will influence, motivate and enable others to contribute toward there effectiveness & success. This is an excellent trait to have while attending college.

If one wish was given to me I would use it (other than to win this scholarship) to go back in time to talk to my senior self about the difference between high school and college. High school and college are like water and vinegar. Although the two look the same they both yeild a different taste. High school is like the cup of water and is easy to undersatnd. College, which is like the cup of vinegar, seems to look clear and easy but once tasted is by far more different that the water. This is one thing I would really make my senior self understand. The lifestlye and what you study in college prepare you for what you want to do as where high school slightly touches the subject. The most important adivce I would give my senior self is to do my best on tests like the SAT or ACT to qualify for scholarships because unlike high school, college cost a pretty penny to attend. These are a few of the things I'd tell my senior self about college.",

It's as if you never left highschool.  I have met so many new friends at my school.  The people here are so friendly and nice.  I am so proud of myself for being on the honor roll.  Not only does my school give out certificates, they also have a small party for the students who make the list.  There is no need for anyone to be scared of college.

The campus is big and clean especially during covid they cleaned numerous of times during the day making sure everyone felt safe to be on campus. With that being said there are patrol officers all around campus to ensure safety. Professors has helped me throughout my first year, breaking down any questions I have to a specific problem.  "

No one who cares about diversity is going to select this school. You will be treated differently if you are a non traditional student. Classes are insufferable. You have students asking the most ridiculous questions just so their professors will remember them for their recommendation letters. Every question they\u2019ve asked has been answered in the textbooks. Just read. If you hate suck ups don\u2019t come here. The classes are easy but that is why this school doesn\u2019t have a good reputation so think about that if you are a premed. Their own med school doesn\u2019t even accept students in the hofstra premed program. "

Hofstra, I believe, is a hub for students and intellectuals who want that conversation, and genuinely want to make an impact, not just pass their classes. It's an extremely diverse campus, which is an amazing experience. Overall, I think Hofstra deserves a to be a well-known name across the Northeast at least, and an option that more people consider."

My teachers have been great to me and they are always available when I have a question or am struggling with anything.  Being a commuter, its always harder making friends compared to living on campus, but with Hofstra being a small campus compared to others I have felt right at home and I've made some great connections so far.  With my mom attending Hofstra previously, I think that has helped me during my overall experience and I and forever thankful.  I hope these next two years provide more pleasure for me and I will be graduating at a proud alumni from Hofstra University."

They know how to instruct for the real world, bringing in professors with experience who then give students as much experience n the classroom as possible. Hofstra students get involved, not only in their major but in things that they are passionate about. With over 140 majors and a club for every interest, Hofstra really is a great place not only to discover yourself, but it also allows you to reach your goals and leave here saying \"I got this!\""

                "Comment": "I cannot tell a lie: I am without a doubt a proud member of the Hofstra Pride. Hofstra University truly is an amazing school containing an endless stream of opportunities. The campus itself is gorgeous and pretty big for a private university, but still not so big that it's overwhelming. From the very first time I stepped onto the campus I got a \"homey\" feeling, and that has stuck around throughout the years I've been there. The community on campus is great as well, we have so many clubs that there is literally something for everyone.  \nSure, Hofstra is not at all located in a college town, in fact, it still baffles me that such a nice university located in such less than ideal town - that's putting it lightly. However, the atmosphere of the campus itself, the next city over (Garden City), and NYC being a 45-minute train ride away balances every thing out pretty nicely.\nHofstra is a great place academics wise too. Being a Hofstra student opens so many doors to astounding opportunities, not only while you're a student but especially once you've graduated. The resources are definitely there, you just have to take advantage of them. Also, I've come across some amazingly helpful and support professors and faculty during my time there.\n\nMy ONE complaint about Hof - now that they've gotten rid of Lackmann as our dining provider- is hinted at in my review title: IT'LL COST YA. Hofstra is very expensive in every way possible, from the tuition to the housing to on campus dining to the bookstore and more. I seriously die a little inside every time I think about how much student debt I'm in, and I'm still not done yet. It definitely doesn't help that our financial aid office is not the easiest to deal with, which is super frustrating because a lot of students spend A LOT of time having to deal with them. In fact, a lot of the bigger, main administrative offices could use some improvement. A lot of the time I see where my money is going and I'm satisfied for the most part, there have been issues that have popped up and I find myself questioning,\"HOW IS THIS AN ISSUE WITH ALL THE MONEY WE'RE ALL PAYING YOU?!\" \nSo all in all, Hofstra: an absolutely amazing school to attend, but at a price. Literally."

In those 3 days, i toured the campus, got to meet the facility, staff, president, students etc. There is nothing to be afraid of because the environment is so relaxing. Everyone is so polite and respectful. The professors want to help the students if they are having trouble. There is so much access to transportation that you can never get lost. I stayed there for 2 nights and the campus was on another level. We got to explore with our orientation staff for 2 days. They made us sit in classes so we can know how it feels to be a college student. On the last day, we were official Hofstra students. We had to go create our fall schedule with the help of our advisors. Overall, Hofstra makes you feel that you belong here."

Other than being very liberal politically, our campus also has a large LGBT community and is the most LGBT-friendly school on Long Island, with the majority of the population supporting gay rights and equality. In terms of dress and interaction, the students here dress like any other college campus in America. Some wear sweats and uggs to class, others dresses and heels. The environment here isn't very cliquey, however there are some distinct geographic groups. A large chunk of our campus are commuters from the nearby Long Island areas, then there's the new yorkers and New Jerseyans, the large chunk from the nearby Eastern states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, etc. And the rest of the country, the group that I'm in--coming from Colorado. Before coming here, reading reviews I saw many complaints about the \"entitled\" population here due to the cost of the school. However, most of the kids I've met are on scholarship with student loans, just like any other school. While there are some individuals who act more entitled than others, they don't make up a prevalent chunk of the population.

Generally, students dress in whatever they want when they go to class. There are some people that like to get up and get ready and there are some kids who roll out of bed and go to class in their sweats. Most students that I've encountered have been from Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California.

That's why I did, and you wouldn't believe the amazing group of people I consider my closest friends. The students are not dumb, my personal GPA is a 3.4, and there are plenty of kids who try hard, get there work done, and go places.

Basketball games are pretty big and there are a few other really good programs on campus like wrestling, roller hockey, baseball, cheerleading and dance. There's almost always some kind of game to attend if you are a big sports fan. Keep up with the schedule and you're bound to find something going on. ",

                "Griffin": "Depends on the major, but for arts, they're awful. ",
                "yixuan": "My major is Accounting and International bussiness. My favorite classes are ECO001 and 002, in these classes, I learned a lot about the market and how the sociality market work during our life. My classmates are really very smart, so they can teach me when I got a problem.",
                "Gillie": "The Academic aspect of our school really varies in quality with each teacher, as I think it does at all Universities. Most of my classes are small, allowing the teacher to know everyone and for the class as a whole to bond. I have one class that is slightly larger (around 30 people) in which the professor doesn't really know anyone and not too many people actually talk to each other. I'm in the honors college at Hofstra, meaning as a Freshman I take two specifically honors classes which are taught mostly by deans and other higher up professors who introduce you to many classic works which is definitely useful. My honors classes do tend to be a little more involved and insightful than my regular questions, but that doesn't mean that every class doesn't have many insightful people in them. Also, I'm a journalism major which is a fairly large department on campus. While I haven't started any of my actual journalism classes yet (as those typically are taken sophomore year on), the department has already been great to be involved with. With the Hofstra Chronicle and the Ed2010 club, it's easy to get involved with other people interested in your career on campus. Also, the journalism department is very encouraging of its students to get internships and is very helpful in doing so. The academic requirements, especially for people on scholarship are higher, but nothing that can't be accomplished with a fair effort. Hofstra definitely wants its students to get a well-rounded education, but it's also very, very career oriented, trying to make sure every student will have a job after graduation. Though there are definitely some professors that are generally lesser-liked by the student population, there are also many caring and passionate adults who are willing to help you succeed if you put in the work to do so. ",
                "Meaghan": "Love the academics here. All of my professors know my first and last name. They are all great and really want you to do well here. I enjoy all of my classes because I actually took the time to research the professors and the course to make sure I would like it. Some are a lot of work, but it's college. If you think you're going to get by without pulling at least one all nighter you're wrong. Students here study all of the time, especially the week before and during finals week, the library and hammer are packed. Depending on the class, participation can play a major role in your grade but the professor will make this known. Like in my History of the Holocaust class. It's discussion based so obviously participation is a huge part. I'm a journalism major and love it. The courses are great and everyone in the department is awesome, then again it is one of the better programs here.  You'll get the education you work for. If you spend time and speak with professors outside of the classroom then you're going to get so much more of out it. Whether you want the education for your own sake or for getting a job is up to you, regardless if you put the effort in you will be successful. ",
                "Tabatha": "Professors know my name! Classes are never too big unless it's one of those general classes, like chemistry. But even so professors still remember you. My favorite class so far was Ethics. I only took it to fulfill a requirement but I loved it and am now minoring in philosophy! My least favorite class has been writing. There is a 2 semester writing course requirement here which sucks but as soon as you finish your freshmen year you do not have to take anymore writing classes if you pass the proficiency exam. Students are always studying, either in the library or the computer lab which is open 24/7. Class participation is common in every class I am in. I often over hear students having intellectual conversation outside of class! Students here are pretty competitive, especially the ones in my classes, since I am taking pre-med requisites. It really depends on your major as well. This school is a huge business school so there is definitely competition there. The most unique class I have taken is Sikh Mysticism. It is very interesting and not really studied in many schools. My new major is health science (I used to be biology, but switched because I wasn't too happy with all the work). The health science department is great. They are relatively new so they are doing many things to make their department bigger. It is becoming more popular here. I love the major because the classes I'm taking is relevant to what I want to do in the future. I do spend time with professors outside of class, during office hours if I need it. They usually all have open schedules. Some of the school's academic requirements make me mad because I do not want to do them, but I understand that it is for students to get a well rounded academic background. I believe that the education in this school is geared toward learning for it's own sake. There are many different classes you could take that vary in many topics and there are many majors and minors! The professors are interested in what they teach and it is a school that cares about it's students. :)",
                "Jared": "Professors always know your name whether you speak up or not they make it their business to get to know you. Students vary from studying constantly to an hour before a midterm. It depends on the class and student. Some Hofstra students have very intellectual conversations. Overall the student body is not very informed of politics and world issues. My school. The school of communications still has issues with the structure of curriculum. It is not updated for today's Internet environment or job prospects overall.\n\nI feel the education requirements should be more IT based because that's where the jobs are. Some majors are learning sake based. Many are job oriented.",
                "Tristan": "I'm in the Communications department (Broadcast Journalism major) and I'm absolutely obsessed with it. Hofstra has WRHU, an incredibly successful and student-run radio station, as well as Studio A, which is the largest sound studio on Long Island. The classes range from relatively easy to very challenging, but every single one of them has helped me in some way. Professors are generally great and working in the field, so they know what they're talking about. And they ALL want us to have jobs when we come out of Hofstra; most of them invite us to their office hours to help with our resumes, audition tapes, etc. The Career Center does that too, and is especially helpful for those in business or finance (like my boyfriend), who are looking for internships and jobs. Hofstra is a great resource for that stuff.",
                "Sheryl": "Professors on the whole are great.  My favorite class was a bore for many but I made it interesting and the other students loved the professor, just not economics.  Students are competitive but will help each other.  The requirements are fair and are not too hard to satisfy.",
                "Keith": "The class sizes are generally really small when compared to other universities.  Even the few \"lectures\" I have are still smaller than other people I know at other schools.  The school offers a large variety of majors; that gives a lot of freedom for each student to discover what they want to do.",
                "Mike": "Academics are really good at Hofstra.  Class sizes are small, the biggest class I have been in was 30 students and the smallest was 15.  Professors do get to know you and they do care about you doing well.  The TV department's professors are great.  They love to hear what you have to think and will give you good criticism.  We have bbqs with the professors and it is fun to hear stories from when they were working in the industry.  The TV program is very geared towards getting a job later on.  Every class I take is meant as if it is a job and not a class.",
                "Joe": "I am a Fine Arts major. The professors within the Fine Arts department are really awesome. My focus is Ceramics, and the full time Ceramics professor is extremely talented and has work in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA (I think...). It's really inspirational to have such a talented professor. He makes classes very hands on and makes sure that we are using art as a form of expression. The Fine Arts department is fairly small, and so the students in the department are a close-knit group of people. We also have friends in other departments which can be very diversifying. I think that Hofstra's academic requirements are a less than they should be. I feel like some classes could include a lot more information/projects, but teachers are too relaxed about giving students extra time to work, when the students could get the work done if they just spent the entire class working. I think that the Fine Arts studio classes should be worth more than 3 credits because of the amount of time that the class is scheduled for. The in class time per week for a studio course is 4 hours, yet we only get 3 credits. I think this is an injustice, and thus lowers our quality of work.",
                "Nora": "i like how we have small classes in one of my journalism classes there are 10 students in the class and that makes me feel more hands on and i like that the teacher knows my name because that makes me work much harder",
                "Michael": "Well i think the only professor that knows me is my english teacher considering that i have had him for two semesters straight and its a very close nit class where he gets us involved. Class participation is very common on this campus and encouraged to help all students. I believe that when on campus conversations among the students are intellectual and relevant to the class most of the time. the most unique class i have taken i believe was philosophy intro class i reccomend it to everyone. I believe hofstra's requirements are actually pretty good, and also will provide the student with well-rounded knowledge of any field of interest. I believe it is a little bit of both that hofstra's academic classes are geared to help you learn but when in your major and line of interest then it starts to move to where you are looking at something related to the job that you are interested in.",
                "Emma": "classes are good except for chem. tutors aren't helpful",
                "Kayla": "The majority of my professors know me by name. My favorite classes are my psychology classes and Philosopohy, Religion, and Public Life. Class participation is usually decent. Some students have intellectual conversations outside of class. The psychology department is amazing, but do not ask them for help outside of their department, because they are usually not very helpful. The education here is definitely geared toward intellectual growth AND getting a job.",
                "Sharon": "My favorite class is scuba class.  Most people don't know that we have this class, but I think it's awesome that you can get credit for hanging out at the bottom of a pool for an hour.  We do have tests, but they are a lot easier than regular academic classes.",
                "Tammy": "The classes here are nicely sized, around 20 students a class. The teachers are all also very fantastic. They are very helpful in and outside of class. They always keep to their open hours and have your best interest at heart. Classes aren't an easy breeze, but teachers do everything they can to help you. Being a chemistry major, im in the chemistry/physics building a lot and i've really gotten to know the teachers well. They're a lot of fun to talk to outside of class. There are also some teachers, that i've encountered, that just intimidate the heck out of me because they are simply brilliant. Students here are competitive, but not to a dangerous degree. They would never try to make you do worse in order to do better. Everyone here is always helping others with what they dont understand.",
                "Christine": "My normal class sizes aren't any bigger than about 25 people, so you get the attention you need while being able to blend into the background on a bad day.  There are alot of political conversations on campus, although most students don't seem very educated about the debates they get into.  I've never spent time with a professor outside of class, but it wouldn't be out of the question.  My most unique class has been my most recent major class, where I was able to direct my own productions after only a few weeks, and as a freshman, you're unlikely to find that possibility in other schools.",
                "John": "Really good.",
                "Lindsey": "See above.",
                "Lorie": "The classes here are great sizes, its small enough that you get to know your professor and obtain personal help if you need it. They are genuinely interested in you doing well in the class. Office hours are always posted and kept. Professors (especially mentors at Honors College) always plan field trips and events outside of class that are fun and educational at the same time.",
                "Brianna": "Chemistry. The chem dept is very exclusive, and once you declare, they are very helpful and protective over you. It's a small department, and only a few kids graduate from it every year. The professors will help you wherever they can, they know your name, your personality, they joke with you and will go out of their way for you if you need them. The kids in the department, with the exception of a few, generally think about helping each other through the tough classes rather than getting better grades than the next person. We all look out for eachother, whether we're friends or just classmates.",
                "Matthew": "I have cool professors.  My favority class is Information Technology because the prof. is funny.  My least favorite class is speech communications.  Students are not generally competitive but I'm not in the law school.",
                "Samantha": "Every professor knows my name. They are all always at their office during their posted office hours, which every professor is required to have. They are always willing to help and always go the extra mile. There isn't so much work so that it takes up all of your time but it's enough so that you are fully knowledgeable in the subject area. You truly get out of it what you put in, plus more.",
                "Bevan": "I am very close with my professors. They are very smart. I have had many intellectual conversations outside of class, but I wish I had more.",
                "Mary": "The professors here are really easy to get ahold of and are really easy to talk to about questions or if you are having trouble.",
                "Jessica": "My favorite class would be C&E, because we get to read classic literature and relate the ideas to some of the common debates of today.",
                "linda": "if u get to know your profs they get to know you too, they're really helpful and really want to see you do well",
                "Ryan": "Most of my professor are terrific. I have only had one or two encounters where I have run into some disagreements with professors. Normally they know my name and they get to know the students. They are very understanding and wise about college life. Most of them are very helpful with helping outside of class and they are understanding when it comes to knowing that college students have lives outside of the classroom.",
                "Ash": "My favorite class this semester is Intro to Electronic Music because the professor personally knows many of the composers and inventors we discuss since he helped invent the synthesizer.  It's really cool to learn about a topic from someone that invested his life into it and really knows what he is talking about.",
                "Rory": "classes vary. some are great, some are lousy, just like at any other school. i find honors classes most stimulating because of the attiudes and work ethics of the students taking them.",
                "Torry": "Hopfstra has some really great programs, among them business, communications (film, broadcasting, journalism, etc), and political science. I hear we also have a good Education program for teachers-to-be. You really do get a liberal arts education, which is useful because it gives you skills like critical thinking and analytical reasoning. I would also say your writing develops a bit too. Honors College is especially great--the staff and professors are exceptional. Some honors classes are really tough, while others are just really really interesting. You will be doing some more writing if you're in the Honors College though, but it certainly won't kill you.",
                "kelly": "academics are nice, although some classes are unforunate because they are \"distribution\" classes, which means everyone has to take them, whether they are intersted or not, which takes away from the quality of the learning.",
                "barbara": "the poitical science department is pretty good- the faculty that i've interacted with are all terribly smart, accessible and encouraging. honors college has some tough academic requirements (i'm thinking of Culture & Expression) but i'm glad i've gone through it.",
                "Ben": "the profs are really intelligent, and they're friendly too. some of them are intimidating but only because they're brillant",
                "Brian": "There is definitely a mix of professors. Some are very knowledgeble but are good at teaching but I've plenty of very good teachers too. Many of the general requirement classes are kind of boring but I've heard that as you get further into a specific major it's better.",
                "Joanne": "profs are cool, they are great at helping out",
                "Bob": "Professors are wonderful. They know names and are available for help. I don't really have a favorite class; I enjoy all of them about equally. Class is class, but it is bearable. I am looking forward to taking classes in my major. I don't know much about it or the department yet, so I'm excited for that to happen. I think that it depends on what kind of students you spend your time with as to whether or not intellectual conversations occur. I would not say that students are extremely competitive. I feel like the education is geared equally toward getting a job and learning; getting a job coming later in the four-year experience. I feel the academic requirements are very managable, and am happy that we are now able to register for 18 credits.",
                "Kelly": "The thing I hated about high school was that I didn't feel like I was learning towards anything. My classes here make me feel like I'm learning to be a better person IN MY CAREER when I leave. I've had some awesomely small classes and the professors always manage to learn your name within a week or two. They're also required to have office hours so you can go and get a paper looked at, just chat about class topics, or eventually solicit recommendations. Being a liberal arts school there's a solid amount of core education, but with soooooooo many options for classes it's never boring. I HATE science, so for a science requirement I took Biology in Society, which related to current social and medical events. A million times more relative to what I was really interested in.",
                "Nicole": "I really enjoy the small class size and the numerous opportunities for internships.",
                "Jill": "Most professors know their students by name, which is nice. Students I know have intellectual discussions outside of class, but most of my friends are in Honors College, like me.",
                "Chris": "I have had some brilliant professors, and some i wonder why they were heading the class and not a baboon. The academic environment is not very competitive. I am a b.s. music merchandising major, and was accepted into the program without a formal audition. Furthermore, i feel the academic curriculum to be very weak and unorganized. Most conversations i overhear are of weekend endeavors to bars.",
                "Gabe": "Class sizes are freakin sweet. It feels like high school still. All my teachers know who I am, and I'm pretty comfortable with them. The curriculum is difficult, but not unreasonable (in most cases). What I learn in class definitely percolates into everyday life. I do have discussions with other students outside of class. I'm pretty satisfied so far with the academics.",
                "joanne": "people don't participate much in class, especially early ones. that's why i like honors seminars, because students actually want to be in class (most of the time) and are trying to have educated conversations",
                "Melissa": "My favorite classes are painting classes. Most teachers know our names. Honors classes are stimulating and competative, outside the honors community you have to work to find your niche. the political science department is great- really interesting personalities, very supportive and welcoming, if you put yourself out there to get to know them.",
                "Dawson": "the class sizes are really nice, they're not huge and not too small at the same time.  profs are also really good with responding to emails and being present during office hours. the career center here is also really helpful in resume writing, internship and job obtaining.",
                "Tina": "The Dance Department is really amazing at Hofstra University.  It's got about 80 students so that's pretty large.  Since it has so many students it can afford to bring in really big name artists and teachers.  This also creates a great sense of community and a really creative environment."

            "What are the most popular student activities/groups?  ": {
                "Alexandra": "The most popular groups is most likely the sororities/fraternities ",
                "Malcolm": "Our Greek life is very much alive on campus. But there are over 200 clubs on campus, and many of them are well and alive (with loads of members). If you are a guy (or girl) like me and don't want to be involved with any frats, then join more than one club. I am starting a club myself, and I hope to get as many students involved on campus with mines. Most of our sports are intramural, so if you were looking for college league team Hofstra sort of lacks in that area, but it stills has them. If I had to choose and say which one is most popular now, it would be the Hofstra v. Zombies club. It is a club where students dress up like zombies and human survivors and go around campus attacking one another with Nerf equipment, and turning one another into zombies. It is exactly like a videogame, only in real life. (I am not a part of this club, however).",
                "yixuan": "tennis club! That's the club I love. I meet my closest friends during the mass. we feel for both of us, we matched to each other, then we keep communicate more and more, we went shopping together and we do our homework together when we catch a free time off campus, we take a train all the way to manhattan and shop, and have some fun. It's really very nice. Party?? I will say I don't know, I never been to a college party..",
                "Gillie": "Since Hofstra has a relatively smaller campus, it's easy to get involved and be aware of the various activities happening on campus. While our football team was shut down due to budget, there are still other major campus sports such as Lacrosse and Basketball that the school goes out to cheer for. There are multiple sororities and fraternities on campus but for the most part they aren't all that loud or prevalent in the student body. For my major, journalism, there's the student-run newspaper, The Chronicle, which any one can contribute to, and the ed2010 magazine journalism club, as well as the PRSSA Public relations club which all aid to help students find internships and jobs after school. For performance groups the school has multiple choirs as well as 3 a'cappella groups that are relatively exclusive audition groups, as well as the Masquerade Musical Theatre club which puts on a musical each semester, the Spectrum Players that put on a play, and many dance groups including Dance Works. There are a number of philanthropic groups on campus and it's easy to get involved, and to try things out to find your niche. Over the weekend, there are typically multiple parties at the nearby frat houses which are a walking distance from the dorms, or some people go the nearby bars Dizzy's and McHebes. People who aren't interested in partying or drinking on the weekends often go into New York city to go see shows, museums, concerts, etc. Or for something more local, head to the nearby movie theaters or mall in Garden City. There are always events going on with speakers or performances by the clubs on campus. Hofstra throws a fall festival every year with big name performers and a large carnival, last year drawing in Rick Ross, Joan Jett, Salt 'n pepa, and Taking Back Sunday. Also, Hofstra has now been chosen twice for the Presidential debate, with the next one occuring next fall on campus. There's typically a lot going on and many ways to meet people if you're willing to put yourself out there and try out some different campus activities. ",
                "Meaghan": "There's so many different groups, clubs, organizations and teams to chose from on campus. I'm on the cheerleading team here. I cheer for men and women basketball games this year. The only thing that sucks about the fall is there is no longer a football team here. But the cheer team is still a ton of hard work yet still fun. Being involved helps you make friends and find people you can really trust on campus. Dorming is good too. I live in a suite style and love my roommate and suite mates, they're actually some of my best friends. We always go out together, whether is a Tuesday night at the bar or we're just going to get dinner. They're seriously the best. But there's lots of other ways to meet people. The bars, the library, the gym, just be willing to talk to anyone. Or the games. Basketball games are pretty big here and baseball is in the spring. Many of the kids on the baseball team are in frats too. Greek life is pretty popular, but if you aren't in it it's not going to be the end of the world. There's plenty of people who don't participate in Greek life. If you're trying to get off campus for a little while, the Roosevelt Field Mall is about 5-10 minutes away, so close. There's a ton of places to eat and hang out. Plus, the city is only a 35 minute train ride. Me and my friends go in a lot. Its always fun to go into the city especially during Christmas season with all the lights. ",
                "Jared": "Greek life, Sport clubs and Student Government top the list of student interests on campus. Students are very friendly overall towards one another. Guest speakers and athletic events have a decent attendance but hardly ever standing room only. The dating scene is mostly non-existent. A lot of students prefer hook ups. Greek Life is important but definitely not required. Students involved are very busy and do a lot on campus but those not involved have a good time too. There are concerts, festivals, movie nights on the weekends or trips into the city.",
                "Tristan": "I could go on for days about this, but I won't. There is never a boring moment at Hofstra, from concerts to free movies to speakers to comedians. We're also a 30-minute train ride away from NYC. And there are a few college bars just across the street from the school, so they're safe to get to and REALLY fun.",
                "Mike": "There are a lot of activities on campus.  Being involved in film, I am working on a film shoot almost every weekend so I do not do what most students do.  For most students the weekend starts on a Thursday and they will go out to a bar and get wasted.  Greek life is huge at Hofstra, they are everywhere.  There are so many clubs that I do not even know some of them exist.",
                "Joe": "Many different groups on campus are important to our very diverse campus. I am a member of Masquerade Musical Theatre Co., which puts on a mainstage musical every semester. It is generally a lot of fun. Students propose to direct a musical of their choice, assemble a production team, hold auditions, and run the show from start to finish. It is a great opportunity for students of all different majors. As for the question of whether or not students leave their doors open... it's not actually permitted in most areas of campus. If there have been magnetic door props installed then the residents are permitted, and in this case it is common for the doors to stay open. Everywhere else it is a fire code violation to prop open a door.",
                "Nora": "there are a lot of different groups on campus for clubs and stuff so everyone has one club that they can just fit right into",
                "Michael": "Most students from when i lived on campus started to leave their dorms open when everyone in the dorm got acquainted with each other and more comforable. i met my closest friends from the dorm and also in my class that involved a lot of partner work which helped in getting to know those people better. i believe people party pretty much everyday, but thursday and the weekend are the biggest party days. i stayed home and went to work last weekend,",
                "Sharon": "I wish we were able to leave our dorm room doors open so we can air out the room and can say hi to people as they pass by in the hall, but the fire code doesn't allow it.  But most of the time we leave our doors unlocked so people just drop by anyways.  Now that I think about it, it might not be so safe to leave them unlocked all the time, but so far none of my stuff has been stolen.",
                "Tammy": "Most students here are interest in Greek life, but just because you're not in it doesnt mean you sit at home on the weekends doing homework alone. There is always something to do on campus. Events are always being planned, like movies or speakers. We just had a writer from the Simpsons here. Stephanie Tanner was here last year. There have been A LOT of political speakers here since Hofstra is hosting the 3rd and last presidential debate. A lof of these political speakers are legit people who have book and are on c-span. Again there's always the option of going to the city. And with NYC the options of what to do are endless. I mean i could go catch a broadway show whenever i wanted to. Parties, like every campus, aren't exactly scarce. Parties arent the only thing to do, but they're an option.",

There isn't much to do off-campus if you don't have a car, except for going into New York City.  Luckily, a shuttle leaves for the train station every hour, so that's a nice perk.  It's best to meet people at Hofstra through clubs and organizations, that way you'll find people you have something in common with that you'll see often enough before you build a friendship.",

As mentioned before the closeness of NYC provides an endless list of things to do. Hofstra also gets lots of great and interesting speakers who come to campus. Or they plan programs that are great too.",

Frats and sororities are everywhere and I can't seem to escape them... thank goodness Greek week is over. People party all the time, but that's true of any college campus. There's plenty of things to do on a Saturday aside from hitting up Dizzy's (ew) or Nachos or Chrebets. Movie nights, bowling, usually there's some sort of event or movie showing on campus. Hanging out in the dorms with your floor is always an option, too.",

Many wonderful speakers come because of our close proximity to Manhattan, but unfortunately the majority of the seats are empty.  \r\nSaturday night NOT drinking:  either go into Manhattan (which I do often) and go dancing, to a museum, out to eat, etc. (all unfortunately very expensive,) or do nothing.  There is a mall and movie theater in Hempstead if you have a car, and there are often events on campus such as movies or events put on by different clubs, but overall not that many students attend weekend events.",

Partying doesn't seem to affect studies too much, but maybe I'm a bit biased. \r\nThe university sponsors all kinds of events year-round, from more political to more relaxed and social events. This is especially true for first-year students and Honors College students (Honors College has many perks like free tickets to Broadway shows, sports games, etc).",

There is usually something to do whether it's a football game, a play, or a free movie.  \r\n\r\nThe dorms sort of define who you hang out with.

One in the Fall and one in the Spring, with a club fair, live bands, free food, usually one of those bounce house things, so much fun. A lot of times in good weather organizations will do events right outside on the quad so you can stop by on the way to class even! The campus is really centralized around our Student Center, so you can almost always run into someone you know a few times throughout your day.

I came to college expecting to party at least one night every weekend. That hasn't exactly happened. There are parties on campus, but they are usually frat parties. These suck because EVERYBODY goes there. Who would want to go to a party that's so crowded you can't move or talk to anybody new? Not me. My friends and I latch on to any house we hear about that's throwing a party. But these houses will only party once every few weeks. Otherwise we're stuck drinking in our rooms.",

It has a great environment where one can feel safe and the people who attend the school have great attitudes and are always nice to each other. The university provides great food thats enjoyable to all and the housing provides great space for personal items and studying. The location of the school is convenient near the mall, close to many food places and a hospital. I believe that going to this school is a great decision to go to because of all it has to offer and the great atmosphere they provide. ",
                "Malcolm": "I think as far as opportunity goes, Hofstra is a great location to be in. Students have every opportunity to ride into New York City and search for opportunities there. Each department is always sending emails regarding internships frequently. However, the food is over-priced and not that good, neither is the scenery/view. It is rare that you would come across a person who really likes the options it has to offer, in terms of food. If I had to change anything about the campus, it would be those two things.",
                "Griffin": "All I can say is don't Hofstra seems appealing with it being so close to NYC, but that's really the only good thing. I majored in drama, and half the professors were educated at Hofstra! No one in any department knew what they were talking about and they told us if anyone came up to ask why the tuition was so high we should avoid the question. The so called \"BFA\" program is a scam, and without it you're basically paying 60k for no major. The kids who had gotten in came out with no connections, about the same education that AMDA could give you (except 50k cheaper) and a school that looks the other way when you ask why you don't have a job. It says a lot when someone transfers to a community college just to get out of the trap that is Hofstra. The food is awful and the amount of times people found bugs in their food was too many to count. Hofstra is located in the lovely town of Hempstead, known for its gangs and high crime rate. My first year I got three emails a week telling us to travel in groups because there had been students mugged walking back from parties. The school totes their proximity to NYC as a feature yet sets a time limit on the shuttle that takes you to the nearest train station, saying that after a certain time it's too dangerous for them to come, and if you find yourself stuck there then you better know someone with a car. Even the attendance policy, which varies per major, is insane. If you find yourself in the hospital, or just sick, then you better show up to class with an IV because if you're absent more than 2 times they drop your grade and recommend you drop the class. If I could give this school 0 stars I would. If you're even thinking of attending simply because you didn't get in anywhere else (like the majority of people who go to Hofstra, it's a 'well I didn't get into my top choice but this will do' school), I implore you to look elsewhere. I didn't do well my first semester of freshman year due to my family moving and it being a new environment. As a result I lost my scholarship, but when I tried to explain that I was simply getting used to being alone and not having any family close they told me that it didn't matter and that I could appeal again next year. They rope you in by showing you the gym, which is about the only thing they'll spend money on, and have the student guides, who are paid to lie (I know because I went to the training to be one, but when I was told about the questions to avoid: tuition, do people drink/ do drugs). The dorms are small and packed (they have 4 people to a room the size of a normal dorm, they call it a quad). There's so much to say about why this school is terrible, but I'll leave it at a simple DON'T. Don't go, no matter how appealing it sounds, it's not. ",
                "Gillie": "To be honest, I was really nervous to head off to school for the first time. Not the 'I wonder what grade I'm going to get on the quiz' nervous, but more like 'this is the biggest decision of my adolescent life and I hope I didn't mess it up' kind of nervous. I knew why I chose my school: a nice scholarship, right location, good program, etc., but suddenly, in the days before heading to school suddenly everything seemed to be in peril: why didn't I just save money by going to a state school? Why did I a University so far from home? What if I didn't like my major anymore then what would I do. Luckily for me, all those fears and nerves were put to sleep when I came to Hofstra. While it's not the school for everyone, so far I've had the best 4 months of my life. The campus is beautiful and just small enough so you always see friendly faces on the way to class, but just large enough so you don't know everyone and their business. Though the surrounding city of Hempstead isn't much by way of a college town, and can be dangerous and different parts, the town next door, Garden City is very beautiful and has plenty of little shops, restaurants, and one of the biggest malls in America. Also, our school is about an hour trip into the city, making New York accessible for fun on weekends or any necessary trips during the week. The one major thing I could complain about in regards to my school is a slight lack of school pride. Since the football team was abolished due to budgetary restrictions sports aren't a huge part of campus life. Because we don't have that united sports atmosphere, there are definitely many people who could be more prideful about our school. Overall, the academics are good with many programs for many different degrees, allowing people to pursue all different interests. I'm so glad I chose Hofstra University where I've met some of the best people and had some of the best moments of my entire life. ",
                "Jared": "Hofstra is gorgeous. The amount of trees and plants on campus really blows your mind. Compared to the most prestigious and beautifully built campuses in the country, Hofstra still beats many out with the suburban feel of its South (academic side) Campus.\nI would encourage the administration to focus more on improving the aesthetics of the dorms, which in some cases they have, i.e., replace furniture, update HVAC system, light system, redo bathrooms in the high rises, and build more dorms at a more affordable price. \n\nPeople tell me its a good school and a real campus unlike many Long Island colleges, with good job prospects, but way too expensive of a price tag. \n\nI spend most time in the Student Center hanging out or on sunny days in Breslin quad inbetween classes. \n\nIts a college town in part. It has many restaurants and delis in the area that make-up a Hofstra discount and welcome Hofstra students and a lot of students live in off-campus housing. Overall the town and local village are not welcoming of college students. Its suburbia and they don't want intoxicated, loud messy kids in their area. Hofstra is also located in one of the worst neighborhoods in the county. This neighborhood has a high volume of minorities and a high crime rate. The county police and campus public safety are very good at making students feel safe not only on campus but off it as well. Still security could be improved. Not all the campus is gated.\n\nThe administration while clearly trying and succeeding in improving Hofstra's status in national rankings and academic quality, Seems more focused on the school's appearance to the educated community than to its student body. It doe snot focus enough on improving dorms or social life. Becoming very anti-greek, not following most colleges in the leave it alone or turn a blind-eye rule. It has no greek housing and very little money for any clubs.\n\nThe rape scandal brought to light the security flaws of so many non-students on campus and how security measures should be changed.\n\nParking, price and dorm quality are the most frequent complaints of students. The university has not accurately addressed any of these issues over the past ten years.",

Its rare to find someone who knows EVERYONE, but its not impossible to know a large percent of the school population. It all depends on how much you're willing to get out there and meet people. The landscaping is gorgeous here, since it is a national arboretum. There are big grassy quads where (when its nice out) you'll find big groups of kids sitting on studying, reading, listening to music, playing games, or just hanging out between classes/avoiding homework! Its like a picture straight out of a college brochure. Hofstra doesnt have the greatest reputation (because of the stereotypes) but its becoming a better school everyday. The one big flaw is that it lacks a college-town. Since it is located in Hempstead, students dont have the opportunity to walk \"up-town\" and catch a movie, or grab dinner, or do some shopping. Campus is very safe (its a closed campus after 10:30pm) but walking around Hempstead at night isn't the best choice.   Although there isn't a college-town, we have NYC! It's only a 30-40 minute train ride away, so that opens the door for sooo many opportunities! Its a fun place to spend the weekend, and allows for many internship opportunities.",
                "Christine": "What I love about Hofstra is the great opportunities for my major (Video/Television).  Being so close to NYC, there are great internship opportunities, and I got to start with hands-on work in freshman year, which not many schools offer.  I like the size of Hofstra: it's big enough to avoid people you don't like but no so big that you get lost all the time.  I spend most of my time out and about on campus; I love to be outside when the weather is warm: the campus is gorgeous! One of the things that's a turn-off about Hofstra is the lack of support for sports.  I love college sports, but most kids on campus could care less.",
                "John": "Cool students.",
                "Lindsey": "The academics (political science dept.) are awesome - there are a lot of opportunities offered.",
                "Lorie": "Hofstra is a great place. The landscape and set up of campus is really nice and the people are really friendly. The university lacks a college-town but NYC is very close by.  The nearness of NYC opens many opportunities that many other college students dont have. If i please I can go and have a picnic in Central Park on the weekend or go see a Broadway show after class one day. The administration gets to be a bit annoying at times, but what school doesnt have annoying administration? Students of Hofstra are really glad to be here.",
                "Brianna": "The one thing that I absolutely love about the Hof is the campus grounds. This is the time of year when the weather is getting nicer and everything is in bloom. It really is a beautiful campus. When people hear the word \"Hofstra\" come out of my mouth, they say one of two things: \"Good school\" or \"Expensive\". Hofstra costs an arm and a leg and they take money from you wherever they can... administration is a pain and they always seem to screw you over. Like I said before, the campus is pretty...",
                "Matthew": "The best thing about Hofstra are the students.  They are really nice.  One thing I'd change is the food prices.  The school is just the right size.  People ask me if I dorm there since I live so close.  I spend most of my time within the Liberty/Republic area since there is always someone to hang around with and something to do.  There is a lot of pride, it is in our team names.  People say Hofstra looks like an amusement park.",
                "Samantha": "The best thing about Hofstra is the community. Everyone is so nice, helpful and involved. Everyone really cares. Hofstra is the perfect size. There aren't so many people that you get lost in the crowd, but also there is enough so that it's not like you know everyone. There's always things going on and always free food.",

                "Ryan": "My opinion of the Hofstra Administration is that they do not consider what the students want and need. Hofstra is run like a business rather than a university. Rather then implementing things that we students want and need, they do not ask us or create things that typical college students should be surrounded with.",
                "Ash": "Most people at home don't know anything about Hofstra, let alone that it exists.  Those that do think it is a very prestigious East coast school and that it is located in Manhattan.  On Long Island and around New York, it seems like Hofstra has a pretty good reputation for a liberal arts school.",
                "Rory": "i love the tulips in the spring. campus is gorgeous. hofstra's working to appease students by \"going green\" and working to better the dining facilities (although they are alright, as is)",
                "Torry": "The campus is absolutely wonderful. We are recognized as a \"park\" by the New York State Park Authority (or something to that effect). It makes for a truly wonderful experience. You feel like you're in a fairytale when the trees and flowers (and boy do we have a lot) are blooming in the spring. The food is top notch compared to the other campuses I have been to, but after 4 years you get sick of anything, because you're just eating it over and over again.",
                "kelly": "there is absolutely no college town. the city is close by, which is great, but it's unforunate tht there's no local town for us to shop and wlak around in. cars are helpful to keep here because everything is quite spread out",
                "Keith": "The size of the school is great in my opinion.  The student body is large, but half are commuters so it has the feel of both a large and smaller university.  The campus is really nice.  I remember being unsure when driving here and looking around the area of Hempstead.  Hofstra is split in half by the Hempstead turnpike, but while on campus you wouldn't even know there exists a major turnpike a short distance away.\r\nThe food is above average for universities across the country.  However, the price of food is a little bit ridiculous.  But overall the food on campus is still a plus for the school.\r\nOne of the biggest things Hofstra has going for it is the location as well.  The school is a 10 minute walk from the Coliseum, a short drive from the Roosevelt Mall (one of the largest in the country), and then a 30minute train ride from NYC.",
                "barbara": "the area around here is not college-friendly. hofstra itself is nice, but the neighborhood is unforunate",

                "Brian": "Close enough to NYC to take advantage of everything it has to offer but also far enough away to avoid some of it's craziness. Hempstead is a little dirty but its there is plenty of things to do in the area.",

                "Bob": "I think that the best thing about Hofstra is the size. It's just right; not too big, and not too small. People where I'm from don't have any idea what Hofstra is. I spend most of my time on campus in my room or friends rooms, and don't find Hempstead to be a college town. I don't know much about Hofstra's administration so I can't say. I will say that they're not very visible, unless I'm just not seeking them out. The most recent controversy was the ZBT incident. I don't think that there is an overwhelming amount of school pride; we lack a student section at sporting events. The most frequent student complaints include overcharging from Lackmann.",
                "Kelly": "Hofstra's atmosphere is probably what drew me in the most. Being a mid-sized school (app. 8,000 undergrad) it has the resources of a large university and the community of a smaller college. The campus is beautiful, but it's not a campus bubble. I mean, you don't feel like you're stuck on campus for four years. Internships are encouraged (if not required) and the school takes advantage of the proximity to NYC just as much as the students do. There are PLENTY of things to do in the area, and I'm still just barely getting a taste of the stuff the whole Island has to offer after three years here. And it's still a young school. Hofstra's less than 100 years old and is really building up it's reputation among some of the larger more well-known universities.",
                "Nicole": "The recent \"controversy\" on campus would have to be the elections for president of SGA. A former president who was told to step down was running to be re-elected and there was a lot of controversy surrounding his candidacy and he wound up winning the election, much to a lot of people's surprise.",
                "Jill": "There's no real college town... Hofstra kind of is a town in itself. Besides, NYC is 45 minutes away, so there's no real need for a college town.",
                "Chris": "I think there is an overall level of dissatisfaction with the school, and most people feel like they've settled by staying here. If asking a student if they could have gone somewhere else freshman year, i would say the great majority say yes. Even as a senior, i feel as if my decision to stay here was one of convenience, after deciding the the school was \"okay\" after my first year.",
                "Gabe": "I like Hofstra's size. I have met plenty of people that I have become close to, and yet I still meet new ones everyday. The campus is a good size as well. Everything that I need is in reasonable walking distance. \r\n\r\nThe surrounding area is also decent. There's plenty of places to eat off campus, which is a nice change of setting. There's a few movie theaters close by, and for some reason there is a cluster of malls within a short distance of campus. In no way would this be considered just a college town.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is the price of food. Hofstra uses Lackmann dining services as their provider, and Lackmann's prices are ridiculous. The company doesn't seem to realize that most college students and their families don't have extra money to burn on food. It seems to be taking unfair advantage of the student's needs.",

DO NOT hang around the wrong kids, and by that I mean do not do drugs or party, the consequences are not worth the hour of fun. Senior year is even worse with no freedom. Read the emails that the school sends and do not be afraid to talk to the guidance counselor, even if she forgets that you even exist, sometimes you have to take the initiative. Apply to colleges right away, apply for financial even sooner, and apply for the scholarships offered to you by the community.

Going back in time I would remind myself that I am young, with all of the time in the world, take some time to experience at least five totally different lines of work to determine the lines of work that you do or do not want to go into, it may surprise you to find where your interests lie when there's a practical application associated with what you're learning. I found that I liked art more as a hobby than a profession, I hated waiting tables, I have no talent for construction or painting, although I enjoy both for short periods of time but I have a surprising passion for medicine.

You\u2019ll be embraced for who you are and enhanced for who you are not, both by peers and professors.\n\nBut despite your new friends and trusted mentors, you have the right and responsibility to stand up for yourself, to take care of yourself. College away from home is the time you learn who is truly responsible for you: you. Everything mom nags you about ad-nauseam? She\u2019s right to remind you. Because amidst this newfound freedom and opportunity, experience and wonder, might come a lost grip on the important stuff. Nourish yourself, protect yourself, be your own advocate and have your own back. Stay true to yourself while welcoming in new possibilities. That balance will save you.\n\nOh, and focus on your work.

I would tell myself that college really is going to be a new beginning where I can change myself for the better and become someone who actually benefits society and does what before she could talk about doing.

Don't be so stressed out about college and learn to relax and enjoy life. You will know who your true friends are in time so don't stress out so much about life.

It will help, because part of why I have a low GPA is that when someone wanted to hang out with me, I would always say yes no matter how much work I had to do. I am just learning, at this late stage of the game, how to say NO. Another piece of advice I wouldn't hesitate to give myself is to SET MY ALARM CLOCK! Especially if you have early classes (9am, 9:30am, etc), which will probably happen as a freshman, you need to be on time. Many professors may not care, but there are a whole lot of them that will and won't hesitate to deduct points from your final grade if you exceed a certain number of absences or tardies. \n\nI would give anything to go back and give myself these crucial pieces of advice.",

The real burr that burrowed into my buttocks and inspired to set myself straight was the creeping awareness of what weight money matters have.  Negligence of payments for school expenses left me feeling dirty and destitute - no food as the meal plan is forfeited, concentration taken off of classes and put to scrounging for free food.  Survival is made priority one.  Times when I had a full stomach I could focus on final papers - but try academic success without any nourishment!  What a boon loans are in those moments, sating the ravenous belly!

Listen intently and hear what they have to say, then retain the nuggets of wisdom and proceed as your heart and values prompt.\n\nAlthough you will encounter individuals who are different than you or may have drastically opposite views, always be open. Every single person you encounter has something to offer. Whether they are sharing a piece of information, or even just teaching you patience, remain open minded in every circumstance. Use every interaction to grow as a person. In college, you are not only expected to mature academically, but you are also expected to develop your emotional and cultural capabilities.

It was difficult because I decided attend a school 5,000 miles away from my home and felt too shy and intimidated to open up to anyone. Looking back on it, I would have told myself as a high school senior to be more open with people and situations. I disagreed with the \u201ccollege life\u201d of partying, and now I just accept it for what it is. Not everyone partakes in it. Also, being friendly with others by striking up a casual conversation will not hurt. Having acquaintances is better than having no friends at all. And if people are mean, what ultimately matters is that you are not. If people look at you judgingly, never take it personally because in actuality, everyone is equal. I had a miserable freshman year out of the fear of not being accepted by others. I learned that if you accept others, more likely than not, they will accept you.

Fifth, apply for more scholarships and do it in the fall before all the deadlines arrive or pass. Sixth, you have a right to live and feel comfortable in your dorm: it is your room too!

I have also learned to challenge myself by taking the extra step to be involved in cultural events and clubs that I might not have thought about otherwise. I also learned that every single experience I've had in college, both good and bad, has made me a better person. Just the simple act of doing something new, whether or not the outcome benefits me directly, made all the difference in turning me into the kind of person I am today. College has taught me that with this mindset and hard work, I can do anything that I set out to do.

We all felt our hearts race when we got report cards, test scores and acceptance letters, each one feeling like it's own glacier which was about to sink our hopes of becoming succesful adults. \n     Now that I've lived through that whole precess and come out on the other side, I can safely say that while the college application process may seem like a sinking ship at first, if you take a deep breath, relax, and stop stressing out about everything, you can finish it all and still maintain your sanity. Don't stress, don't panic. It will all be fine and you'll end up the better for it.",

No one prepares you enough for just how different it will be to attending high school.  \nCollege has enabled me to make friends that i will have for a life time. It has given me the chance to make relationships with my professors, where theyre not just my teachers but people i can also go talk to for career and social help.  It has also taught me how to grow up, and actually become more of an adult. At the end of every school year i can now look back and see just how much knowledge i've obtained and how much more confidence i have for myself as each year brings me closer to my career destination.\nAll in all, i take my college experience to the fullest, and i dont take it for granted one bit. All the money and time spent for a 4 year education will turn out to be a priceless adventure, and an experience i will always remember.",

Going to an out-of-state college I was entering an atmosphere where I was walking in alone. No family or friends to assist in the transitioning process.  I quickly learned that the only way to survive was to get to know people and let them tell me about their past experiences and also share mine.   Once this happened, I was no longer alone and that was what I needed to help me through.   Homework was no longer a stressor because my friends helped me through.  When I was dealing with family problems or issues back home, they were there to get me out of my room and help me enjoy life a little.  These are the same guys who have graduated and still check on me to make sure that I am doing everything necessary to also graduate and be successful.  They have been the reason that college is valuable for me to attend.  They have helped me blossom into an amazing human being: more confident, more outgoing, and soon to be more successful.",

Before college i was quiet and didnt really talk to anyone because i  didnt like people because they were mean and i couldnt trust them, but when i got to college i quickly made a lot of friends and started trusting them one by one . This made me a little bit more comfortable talking to people and i know i need to have better communication skills  in order to succeed in life.

A place of greater diversity and business, this has therefore exposed me to a different aspect of reality, which I appreciate. I have additionally discovered a higher level of dedication in myself, due to a deeper exploration of my ability to be patient. This significant experience I have been awarded through being an athlete on a team where I am not the best player or the favorite. Lastly, but most importantly to my life, I have gained the greatest friendships through my college experience. All my life I have searched for a certain kind of friendship, honest, understanding, and balanced. Yet I have never found the kind of relationship which I have myself, always promised to give, until Hofstra.

Naturally, I mingled with peers, and I was astonished with some of their views. Meeting different people and listening to them made me think about my beliefs and maturity. I met a lot people in my first semester and I feel this experience has helped sculpt me into what I should be. \nThough, I did see the differences in each of us, but I saw the kind of people in this world. Meeting different people changed my views more ways than one. Some thoughts were negative, which led me to see some are untrustworthy, manipulative, and distasteful.

The faces around you belong to strangers, your family is suddenly not around 24/7, late night meals tempt you everywhere, your sleeping hours suddenly dwindle, and your classes seem to be in buildings you just can't find on the campus map. It's like the universe is making every little thing work against your favor and you can't seem to regain control.  But alas, be comforted because there's this little magic thing called time that will heal all your wounds.  Those strangers will soon become some of your closest friends, your eating and sleeping habits will find balance once you get used to your schedule, you'll be reunite with your family once your first break comes around, and those buildings will suddenly appear on your map.

I applied at several places, never called or checked the status of my application, but prefered to hang with my friends. I should have spent the time to find a job, which would have helped relieve the burden of college tuition off my parents shoulders. With two younger sisters and separated parents money was tight when paying for first semester of college.  We came very close to being unable to pay for the second semester.

Although I love it, my family's financial situation is very bad because of Hofstra's expenses. I would go back and tell myself to work harder to get more scholarships. In addition, I would tell myself to look at a lot of other schools of less expense. Therefore, I would have maybe picked a different school, keeping my family's needs in mind. Also, I would have looked more deeply into what types of majors I would have wanted to do. I wold have told myself to take a deeper look into possible majors and what I would have wanted to do with my future.

Don't worry about grades as much as getting everything you can from your last year of a free education.  Try your hardest to get things changed in the high school that you think need to be fixed. Get involved with the community. Having a drive to interact with locals around school will follow you to college where you can volunteer and make a difference in more people's lives.  \nDo homework  at home.  Don't wait until the class period beforehand.  It's a bad pattern because college homework means more and should be given the proper thought and time to complete.  Do as many scholarship applications as you can.  The smallest amount helps in the long run.  \nAnd have fun!  Learning is fun and although so many people do not want to be in high school senior year, you do, so don't let them bring you down.

The biggest advice I would give my younger self would be take time off and not rush through the college life. The time could be anywhere from a semester to a year. The draw of this would be to experience the real world and gain an outward view college life. \nI have done a lot of review and that's one thing I felt I lacked as a student. I lacked the foresight of what it all really meant.  An advisor said it best, ?when you?re here, you're thinking I need to do this to get out quick.? It wasn't so much about taking in the environment and building a life. It seemed more about doing the daily class routine which I was accustom to for how many years of my life.

I would make sure that I understood how important my friends are, and to take it seriously when a friend seemed upset, because she might have gotten herself into trouble. I would tell myself to be more open to clubs, to audition for the Acapella group, and to not be afraid of anything. Because I've found out I'm braver than I thought I was.

I would also tell myself to join as many clubs as possible especially the rowing club, Hofstra Crew, which I am actually a part of, because joining it was by far one of the best decisions of my life.

I had to learn the hard way that people do not come from the same background that I do. I realized that I was ignorant of other people's cultures and ethnicities.

I can't say I was immune to this stereotype when I first chose to go to Hofstra either. I was a little frightened, coming from the pasty state of Colorado, that I would arrive into a sea of orange skinned, tall haired, Snookie idolizers. My friends, my family, and even one of my teachers--who actually said to me on the last day \"now don't go get all long island on me\"--taunted me that I was going to go away and come back with a lahhhng iiisland accent and a new, more florescent skin tone. However, the guido/guidette population here is at a minimum, most people are normal kids, and the closest most of my fellow students have gotten to the Jersey Shore is through their televisions on Thursday nights. While there is the occasional Snookie poof or lahng island vernacular, for the most part the population of our campus is the same as any other college campus, and I can proudly go home to Colorado as a proud non-sterotypical Long Islander.

I am an African American first generation from out of state and I have never felt more alone in my life. There isn't much of a social life here at Hollins and there have been multiple occasions where I have felt I could die and no one would notice. To make matters worse, they don't have enough janitors and there is always hair in the showers. If they would use that money donated to hire more cleaning staff and fix the roofs that would be great. Hollins has been a home for some and a lot of LGBT but there is racism against her and some professors are passive-aggressive and insensitive. Yes, you can reach out to just about anyone by email and expect a response but with such a small campus, there is no privacy and trust in one academic person. my friend had a miscarriage and she truster her academic advisor with this information and all of her teachers found out. Just overall students, black students, first generations, please, and I beg do your research. Read the environment, look at the social life and notice not everyone is happy and alot of people transfer out for a reason. "

The students and professors here are amazingly kind and helpful. The food is buffet style and actually quite good! Plus there\u2019s plenty of variety, including a salad bar and vegan bar always available. There\u2019s also a grill downstairs where you can get anything MTO. The classes are small - a max of 25 students as a first year, and as few as 6 students a class in upper level classes. There\u2019s plenty of sports here, including a riding program. The campus is small, and absolutely beautiful. There\u2019s tons of events constantly occurring on campus, and there\u2019s tons of things to do off campus as well.

I was only a few months into the first semester when I realized how much I regretted attending Hollins. Don't get me wrong, it's a stunning campus. Really. For a small, private school, it's lovely. It's the people that rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI have never met a group of people that were so volatile about everything. The misandry ran rampant across that campus, and I'm all for feminism, but really? Going so far as to crucify all men is too much and not okay. Plus, for a campus that loves to promote acceptance and love, they sure do seem to have a lot of transphobia. But sure, we support all memebers of the LGBTQ+ community whole-heartedly. \n\nIf you can look pass the lack of community they try to imply that they have, as well as the garlic covered food (seriously, it's as though everything is bathed in it at all times), then it might be the place for you. It wasn't for me, but I wish you the best."

                "Comment": "Hollins has a stable foundation for academic growth and the discovery of knowledge. While no academic department is perfect, there is no shortage of professors dedicated to helping their students achieve the highest, seemingly-unattainable goals. Even when office hours are done, everyone is just an email away, creating a mentorship community of encouragement. The Hollins community is also devoted to helping students find their niche. From athletic teams to the talents of our theatre, new students are surrounded by people who love what they do\u2014and want to share that love with others. \nWhat Hollins could use more of, though, is empathy. The physical campus is VERY inaccessible to those not in the narrow window of socially acceptable ability. When the issue of our numerous stairs and few ramps enters the conversation, the administration finds a way to avoid the subject of ability-discrimination\u2014usually with the excuse that to replace various stairs with ramps would be to detract from the historic value of the campus. The lack of empathy for the differently-abled, through this method of inaccessibility, is something that can only be changed with the raising of voices and the determination to not stop fighting for inclusivity and acceptance. Therefore, my observation of the situation is not discourage differently-abled people from the school, but to raise awareness for what we need (I say because I am a differently-abled person effected by Hollins\u2019 inaccessibility). \nIn a community focused on the continuation of education, there is a lesson Hollins\u2019 leaders are struggling to learn\u2014we are not all the same and that is beautiful.

Some are a bit tricky and their classes might be difficult, but they will not fail you intentionally. They will help as much as possible to help you get through their class. There are some community issues with race and the rules of the school which students are looking to change, but over all, I really enjoy this school and I am here to get an education."

The small class sizes are amazing; individualized time with the professors is amazing. Hollins also requires their students to take classes outside of our major, which can be annoying but it pushes us to think differently. I never would have found out about school psychology. The downside of this school is the tuition,  the trans policy, and lack of students of color. The tuition rates are about 52,000 is year (32,000 a semester). The trans policy does not let trans women enroll unless they have already undergone gender reassignment surgery. Trans men are allowed but only if they have not started transitioning to men or currently on any medicine (steroids, testosterone, etc.) So be mindful of that if you are a trans student. "

Not only is Hollins a private institution, but it is also private in the sense that it\u2019s secluded and hidden from the interstate. The campus is absolutely beautiful and extremely welcoming. The dorm size is larger than most other colleges. Overall, Hollins is a spectacular campus. \nThe aspect of Hollins that I like the most is the amazing stories that alumni have. With the J term, there are many different chances to travel, study abroad, and intern across the world. There was one story that resonated with me: One student, I will call her Student A, was doing independent studies in London. Her mother\u2019s credit card, which was joined to hers, had to be terminated, so she had no money in a completely different country. She went to a Hollins alumni, explained her situation, and Hollins gave her a lump sum of money and later charged it to her account. That story resonated with me because one of my factors when choosing a college was that I did not want to be only a number. The Hollins alumni remembered the student and helped her out the best way she could, which is the type of people I want to know from my college. Hollins does everything it can for its students and that tight-knit community is something I want to be a part of. \n"

Hollins is truely unique."

You have never learned to put down your defenses and you often feared being wounded by others if you ever were to appear weak for once. Intelligence has always been number one and emotions were a sign of weakness. However,  I need you to understand that your greatest allies will not care about your grades. They will not judge you if you break down in tears and you must know that you will grow to love these people. Yes, keep up your grades; yes, stay strong when people do attack you with words, but don't you dare be afraid to find friends. Grades are only part of the college experience; you will learn that. Learn sooner than later that emotions are necessary to connect with not only fellow students but professors- and they want to see you feel. You have fought so hard that you have forgotten that you are more than just a grade. Remember that you are a human being and that emotions are natural. Nothing is wrong with a few tears; you will feel better than you ever have before when you learn to share them with others.",

Many paths lead to one destiny; take risks and explore your surroundings and yourself; don\u2019t just look in front of you. What\u2019s around you is what you need to meet your goals. Bring with you every piece of knowledge, and every lesson you learn from your mistakes to become a better person.

Moving forward is necessary, but if you forget to eat, to laugh, to try new things, and to build a community, you won\u2019t get far.

You have the rest of your life to be stressed (trust me, there's plenty of things to stress out about in college!) Enjoy your last year of high school, your last year with the friends you've had since elementary school, your last summer with absoluetly no responsibilties. Go be young and reckless. College will come sooner than you think, and here are a few tips for when it does. Invest in a blazer/business attire - you're going to have a job interveiw eventually. When someone invites you to dinner, GO. Get as many general education classes as you can out of the way freshmen year- you don't want to be stuck taking them as a senior.

Study hard to get a high gpa as many scholarships are merit based, and universities ang colleges especially look at gpa. Start at a community colleege, make sure your classes will transferto two prospective universities you wish to attend, and reviece an associates degree before moving on to a bachelors. The cost is less, and it leaves you with a sdegree to put on your resume when applying for jobs. File your fafsa as soon as possible, and study hard for all standarized tests as thier scores also are considered by most colleges.

So far I have gained amazing friendships, not only with students, but with my professors as well. I have only been through one semester of college and I already have had so many opportunities here. \nHere is a small list I compiled of why it has been a vaulable experience while attending Hollins University:\n- Professor know your name and want to help you succeed\n- I am not afriad to ask for help\n- I have made life-lasting friendships\n- The finincial aid staff really wants to help make it afforable\n- I have my first job as an employee at my university's library and all my earnings are directly applied to my tuition\n- There are volunteer opportunities\n- Students get to climb a mountain with their crazy professors and President\n- I am on the Tennis team \n- I am confident and more outgoing",

Having this type of education gauranteed me the knowledge to expand my horizons and contribute to most field of education and conversation. And finally, the fact that it was a women's college. This brought many varieties of people with differences in race, culture and sexuality. I enjoyed being dispersed in that and learning about all sorts of women.

I have come to realize that I, in essence, chose my family for the next four years, those with whom I will be eating, studying, and rooming.  By chance, the small, all-women's university I chose (considering only academics and tuition) nourished the kind of personal, sisterly environment without which I could not succeed. I would not have been comfortable expressing myself (in- and outside of class) at a larger, coed school.  If I could speak with my high school self, I would explain that social atmosphere is as crucial as academics, and that the ?small? and \"all-women's\" descriptions I ignored would soon become very important to my development as a writer and as a person.

Find the school that fits you. Make sure it offers a variety of subject areas that you are interested in. Experiment by taking classes you would never think of taking. They may surprise you with new knowledge or help steer you in a life direction. Just as important is the social life. You will make new and better friends that will help you learn about yourself. Time management skills and better study habits will develop quickly as you find your place with in the world of the school. Stick with what works for you and what you need.

While attending school full-time, I have two jobs.  My money goes towards tuition, living expenses, and bills; the hours consistently impede my social life.\n\nRegretfully, I realize I quit that job out of fear of confrontation, irresponsibility, and laziness, despite calling myself mature.

Start planning to go abroad when you are a freshman and talk to your advisor often. They help you plan out all of your classes and talk you through some of your hardest choices.  Its good to check in with your professor often. Lastly, set aside time for things that are close to your heart, like family.  Take every day one step at a time.

I would tell myself that although parties and big events is not your reason for picking a school, it would be nice that you ask the students what they really do for fun because the brochure may be lying to you. Also, find out what your is your mom's plan for helping you. Do you know if she wants you to move away? Can she handle helping you with finances if this school won't give you as much aid as they promised? What if your mom becomes sick, then who do you depend on? The hard times will come sophomore year.

When you enter school for orientation, turn off your phone and unplug your computer.  Allow yourself to meet people.  Risk making a fool out of yourself to connect with other people.

But even if you find, once you have an enrolled in a school, that it is not perfect for you, don't dismiss it outright -- get involved.  Focus on your studies, but don't keep your head buried in a book all of the time.  No place will feel absolutely perfect, no matter what the ads tell you -- especially if you don't get involved with campus life.

So my advice to new students and their parents would be an extention of my father's wisdom.  I would tell them that you should approach the college experience with an open mind and a willingness to change and be changed.  For example, if you are unhappy with your college's club offerings, create a club that shares your interests!  You will meet new friends and promote a new awareness of your interest on campus.\nTake the next four years of your life, and soak up as much as you can.

When looking at colleges, choose one that provides opportunities to continue the interests you had in highschool and also gives you a chance to try new things. Every school has clubs, activities, and volunteer work that a student can join. Larger state schools have a group for just about any pastime, while at small opportunities abound to play a sport or be in a theatrical production, even if you have very little experience. \n\nTalk to the professors and staff! The most important part of college is to learn, grow, and expand yourself. A faculty of advisors and professors that are willing to speak with the students one-on-one, to encourage their interests, and direct them to resources are invaluable. Find a school that has a supportive faculty. \n\nExperience the school first-hand! If possible, try the college out before making a decision. Many schools have opportunities for perspective students to spend the night in a dorm with a current student, go to classes, eat cafeteria food, and participate in extra-curricular events. This is a great way to see what going to school there is like!\n\nRemember: find a school that fits YOUR needs!"

The small population and it being one of the few woman's colleges left makes it a unique college. Everyone is friendly including the famous squirrels. The professors know you by your name and you can see the president of the university weekly. The learning atmosphere is amazing as well as the opportunities. Our most famous tradition is Tinker day when the students and faculty dress in crazy costumes and climb Tinker mountain. At the top we play skits and have a cookout.",

I am student who has joined the few clubs offered here on campus that is appealing for me , such as; student government, mosiacs and i even took the time to start up my own organization. The class size is on the average size which is great for me because i feel more in touch to what my instructors are teaching. Ive never had a problem were i am unable to reach my instructors if i have a question, whether that be through email or visiting them during there office hours. I am not to fund of the selection choice of food but it is do able, there aren't many places to visit as we are in a rural area so you would have to travel several miles for entertainment and restaurants. We don't have class on Fridays which is great for me but then again that's just my opinion. I do hate the fact that we cant stay on campus during the weekend because to me that's just weird and sometime it is a bit of a inconvenience with the constant back and forth.

For instance, the meal plan is not all that great. For $800.00 we should be getting more than mediocre food. The dorms are decent.  However, there are times when the A.C goes out, and I'm sleeping in a sweltering hot room. When that's the case, I don't get much sleep. Overall, I love my school. I really do.

You are the one who will attend for 4 years, make sure it is the best fit for you. Learn the deadlines for applying for admission, FASFA and scholarships. Don\u2019t let an opportunity pass you by because you missed a deadline! College is expensive and it will be more enjoyable if you aren\u2019t paying for it out of pocket! Earning scholarships is a challenging, daunting very competitive task. Extracurricular activities and volunteering are your friend for scholarships! Do not procrastinate. It may seem everyone is pulling all nighters preparing for tests and projects, however if you plan your time wisely it isn\u2019t always necessary. However sleep IS a necessity for achieving good grades and staying healthy. Coffee and power naps will only get you so far.

I would also tell myself to do dual enrollment, where I can go ahead and take college courses such as English Composition I and II to get it out of the way because English at a University is time consuming-- especially when you are taking 17 hours of college courses in Math and Science. Overall, if I was more exposed and did my research in volunteering and job shadowing when I was a Senior in High school I could have realized what I wanted to major in sooner.

Even the professors are there to encourage and give you first hand experience on life. They will give you real life examples and tell you straight forward how things happen and the best way to go about things. They are personal, so if you need to talk they are there. My mother just got removed from her job at Notre Dame, and my business professor helped us through the situation and make sure everything would be ok.

Whereas C's are the lower 80's. Student councils have been trying to change this for some time now, however I am not so sure that they have been successful.)\n-close to a train station (in fact if you do not have a vehicle it is very easy to get around campus because it is small.) \n-Philly is a cool city to explore.\n-easy to focus on studies, not much party life. \n"

I was born in the Dominican Republic and I moved to the United States just a year before starting college.  I was not sure what career I wanted to pursue and I was not very excited about going to classes and having to learn everything in a different language.  When I started college I did not appreciate what a big opportunity this was.  I did not appreciate the importance of learning and taking advantage of my college experience.  During my junior year, I decided to become active on campus and join different societies.  I am currently the president of a club and vice president of two others.

I would push my high school self to study more, I would have taken my SATs seriously and take classes for them. I would have told my high school self that high school is going to set me up for my future. My second advice would be to make friends. Friends is whats going to help you through your years in college. My third advice would be to get involved in college! college isnt free, take the oppertunity to go to trips and dances, participate in bake sales for fundraising.

When looking at my children, who are working towards their own wonderful dreams, it's difficult to see clearly what it was I wanted to accomplish then, except to be the best Mom I can to my kids.\nWhen I consider all these things, there is a quote that James Dean once said that I believe I would pass on to my children as well as my former senior self that says, \"Dream as if you will live forever; Live as if you will die today.\u201d\nI still carry the dreams of changing the world and helping humanity, I just strive to do so in smaller degrees with kind words and a smile for others and being a loving example for my children.

To stay focused but not to stress out completely because that would just put me on the other side of the rope and turn my back on school if I felt too overwhelmed.

You\u2019re going to get a quality education, with a gilded diploma to prove it. You\u2019re not, however, thinking of the cost of this diploma.You\u2019re going to go to community college, and you\u2019re going to love it. Your classes are going to be challenging. You\u2019ll sit by twenty-one year old mothers who inspire you with their determination. You\u2019ll learn biology is actually kind of interesting. You\u2019ll make the Dean\u2019s list. You\u2019ll learn, you\u2019ll grow, you\u2019ll thrive, and two years later, after you\u2019ve worked harder than you ever have in your life, you\u2019ll apply for your dream school and get in. So don\u2019t frown at that tiny little campus down the street. It is on that campus where you figure out what your dreams are. It\u2019s where you discover who you\u2019re meant to be.  Good luck.

I thought I was the only one who was having a difficult time adjusting, but once I started to make friends in my classes, I found that they were facing some of the same troubles that I was.

In 4 years I would be out and have all my holidays and summers off. Now I am in health care and have been in school almost as long as a doctor would be, with the same debt but not the same future income. I doubted myself that I could work in the hospital envitronment and deal with the compotition in health care. I was picked out a lot of students for a 22 spot program to complete my degree in radiology. I did it. If I would have followed my dream in the first place I would be out of school, with less debt, and starting the rest of my life. Follow your dreams and doubt yourself!

If I could go back in time, I would definitely tell myself to begin as an undeclared major and explore my options before jumping in.  I would also tell myself to try and ween myself from teenage life to adult life before college begins so that I wouldn't be thrown into the finances and the extreme differences between college and high school. This could be done by doing research on financial aid and financial options and getting in touch with current college students and asking how they helped themselves transtion from high school to college.",

Advice I would give myself would be to focus primarily on academics the first months of college. Joining school activites and such is a great way to make friends, but it is necessary to focus on academics and getting into the flow of school. It is also beneficial to pace myself and not cram for a test hours before  because nothing is learned by cramming. By pacing and prioritizing, work can be completed little by little each day so that I am not overwhelmed. It is important to not focus on how many friends I have and what social activites to join, but to focus on academics and start my Holy Family career on the right path.",

I was preparing to go to college at the time but just then I thought it was a waste of time. \"What was the essence of seeking so much education if you can get rich from diamonds,\" I said to my self. Whenever I get money from the sale of diamond, I would go to the night clubs, cinemas, or hang around with pretty girls. Not long however a civil war broke out in my country and, like a lot of other people, I became a refugee in the neighboring country after fleeing. Life really became hard for me in the camp because I did not even have my high school diploma. Those who were graduates or those who had their high school diploma had a better chance of survival.

Finally I would tell myself to have more confidence in my learning capabilities and challenge myself with advanced classes.",
                "Svitlana": "The first advice I would give myself is to gather as much information as possible about all colleges and majors.  Talk to people you know around you that went to different colleges and have experience with it. The most important thing is to sit and think what you want to do for the rest of your life that you will enjoy. Instead of focusing on just one college, many colleges or universities should be taken into consideration for more options and opportunities. Plan ahead to know which is a better way to go.  Set your mind on something and stick to it till the end. I know that would've helped me for sure. I have changed my mind many times about what I wanted to do in life and where I want to go to school. That made things very complicated.",
                "Pedro": "If I could go back and tell myself advice about college, there's only two things that I would tell myself. One thing is to be more focused on school work and not wait until last minute to do somethings no matter how easy the assignment can be. Although some assignments may be easy, its better to get everything out of the way early so you won't have to stress about it later. Another thing I will tell myself is to start looking for different scholarship opportunities earlier. I honestly wasn't thinking about the cost of college, I was thinking more about how everything was going to be like. My freshmen year wasn't so bad financially, everything went well, but then sophmore year, things got a little more difficult which resulted in me getting transferred closer to home. Other than that, everything else I am satisfied with.",
                "Carly": "I would tell myself to start doing things for myself. I mostly do things for the benefit of others. In a way that set me up to get hurt by a lot of people during my freshman year of college. Although it has made me a stronger person I wish I would have known this before. It distracted me from my school work and the things that were more important during my freshman year. I cannot wait to start my sophomore year and start all a new. I won't let anything stand in my way.",

I would advise to learn about the school, visit and talk to students on all levels about their experiences. Know and understand the school\u2019s requirements for program completion and what the school is willing to do for me as a student. I would advise to look into the school\u2019s career services, internship requirements and job placement. I would strongly suggest learning about the campus life and learning about the professors. I would suggest looking into the schools tuition and scholarship programs, payment plans and financing options. I would suggest looking into the schools off campus courses, schedules and transferring possibilities. I would also suggest having a clear view of my program. Larn about the school's programs including counseling. I would also be interested in finding out if the school is environmentally friendly. In sum, I would stress the importance of understanding my future school in all aspects and hope that is where I would gain best education and experience",

My only adivce to myself would have been to begin saving in order to alleviate the struggles of financial hardship.",
                "Morgan": "If I could go back to being a senior in high school knowing what I know now about college, the advice I would give myself in order to be better prepared would be to take SAT preparation classes to try to get more finical aid from Holy Family University. With the demands of maintaining a stellar GPA, it is virtually impossible to uphold a full-time job to pay for college tuition. The financial options available to me are sparse.  In addition, I would have taught myself the importance of time management, because when college arrived there were more responsibilities than there was in high school.  My freshmen year of college was stressful because of my inability to manage my time successfully. I thought high school was so easy, and I misconceived that college would not be any different. In high school I spent more time worrying about my social life than my grades and academics, where as in college it\u2019s the complete opposite; I am more motivated and driven to perfect my academics. Finally, I would have learned how to be more self sufficient in asking for help when needed to have the chance for more opportunities.",
                "Brandy": "I would definitely tell myself that college is not the same in high school.  In high school, learning came easily to me, I didn't have to study a lot, and all I have to do was my homework and I was able to pass classes.  In college, things are completely different, when I first started, I dropped the ball because I thought that I would have just as easy a time as in high school, but I quickly discovered that it is not, and I have to study very hard.  I wish I would have been better prepared.",

As I am concluding my second year of college, I know how much studying a college student does, so I would give that advice to myself as a high school senior. Another piece of advice I would give is not to be afraid to talk to classmates and make friends.  I have made so many friends at college, so I would tell myself as a high school senior not to be scared and to make friends.",

I thought it would work out for the best for me and it didnt. I'm not unhappy with having my cosmetology license, it is a great opportunity for me still, but I feel as though my first year of college would have gone a little more smooth. Attending Holy Family was the best choice I've made to further my career, and I'm very happy but I just wish I would have done it sooner. College is difficult I find myself studying much more than i used to in highschool, so I suggest starting to get organized and learn study tips and techniques. You're going to love college!

You are about to become someone completely new. E.E. Cummings once said, \"It is difficult to grow up and become who you really are.\" That is the greatest truth you will soon come to know. Not only must you prepare to live somewhere new, in a bed that is mediocre to the one you've known for 18 years, but you must also be brave. You must be ready to expand your mind and to grow. You are becoming an adult, and for the first time in your life, you know what that actually means. It isn't something everyone is telling you any longer- it is real. This is life and it is an accumulation of glimmering moments which shine like a momentary glance of perfection. It is going to be hard, but be excited because you are about to blossom.",

Through the academic advising, career counseling, and all of the help I gained from the Holy Family staff; I feel I had gained a perfect picture of what the ideal college life can offer seeing as how it had such an impact on my college experience and career.  My ultimate goal is to attend graduate school program in Counseling Psychology program at Holy Family University so that I can apply my acquired critical thinking and counseling skills to the Student Affairs field.  I want every student that I come in contact with to get everything out of their college experience because I strongly believe that it is an important part of not only their future career, but an important part of finding out about life and who they truly are.",
                "Adriana": "I would tell myself that it is okay to break free from the nest,. I think If i were to go away to school I would be more outgoing and more involved with school activites and clubs. i was going to go to a school in delware but I decided to go with Holy Family because it was closet just in case in need my parents. I was not ready to let go but now that I think back I think I could have. Studying at home can be bothering but I do and my grades are good I just wish I could have some fun on campus. I feel I drive thirty minutes to go to school everyday and do not ever do anything fun. I am either at lecture or study notes from the lecture at home. It is not very fun, but I work hard and my grades prove it.",

                "Edward": "The advice I would give to myself if I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior is to follow your heart.  When looking for a college find one that will meet your needs.  What ever it is you decide to do make sure it is what you want to do and not something someone else wants you to do.  This life is your life, you only get one, so make yourself happy and follow your dreams.  Do not be affraid to take a chance, do not hold back, for if you are affraid and hold back how will you ever know what your truly capable of.  Do not be affraid to fail, failure makes us stronger and teaches us how to do things right.  To truly succeed you must work hard, develope good ethics, and treat everyone with respect and dignity.",
                "Helene": "I would tell myself to work harder in college. High school is so different from college. I was a great student in high school, I breezed through with a 3.8 gpa but I always put homework off until the last minute. In my first two years of college I kept procrastinating my homework and reading and I really with I could have told myself to finish my work earlier and not to put it off until the last minute.",
                "Meharunisa": "If I could go back and talk to myself as a high school senior I would tell myself a lot. The transition into college is not easy. It will take time to adjust to its lifestyle. When people think of college, they think parties and fun. But in fact it's nothing like that. For those much serious about their education there is some sacrificing that has to be done. Things that I would tell myself would be to be very organized in taking the next step. When there is an assigment due, do not write all over the place, be organized and think outside the box. Another thing would be to take advantage of every little opportunity and plan ahead. The most important advice I would give myself is to plan ahead financially. Student apply for colleges and write essays but they completely forget how they're going to pay for their education for the next couple of years. I would tell myself to apply to all scholarship that I qualify for. Over the summer I would get a job and save as much as I could.",
                "Antonia": "I would give myself the advise of making better choices in regards to planning my future and aslo searched for more oppertunities to help me financially with paying for my education.

                "Alison": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior, the best advice I would give myself would be to change my study habits. If I were to change my study habits back then, I feel like I'd be better off now. All throughout high school I would cram in studying and work at night for something that was due the next morning. I constantly procrastinated with every single assignment and I see now how bad of a habit that was. In high school I could get away with doing that becasue the work was all that difficult. In college however, if you do not study or do your work ahead of time, you will definitely not pass with an A or a B. If I were to drop that bad habit while I was still in high school, the transition into college would have been alot easier. I found myself struggling more than usual because of this and I am still trying to change my ways.",
                "Jade": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior, knowing what I know now about college life and making the transition, the first thing I would tell myself is that procrastination is your worst enemy! If I knew before how much trouble it would cause then I would have started my assignments the day that I got them. Next I would tell myself to be more confident. College is a new place full of new people it is almost like making a fresh start and you can let your personality shine. I would tell myself to be more active and participate in class discussions and activities. In addition I would compel myself to ask for help when I need it. My professors always tell me that they are there to help us if we have any questions or concerns and we should not be afraid to speak up if we have a problem. Last I would tell myself to learn from your mistakes. Take the advice and critique given to you from professors to improve your assignments and better the quality of your work to ensure that you have given them your best.",
                "Vincent": "I would tell high school senior version of myself that things are not as important as they seem to be.  If you miss something, do not worry the world will actually keep spinning.  Prom and parties seem to be really important, and they are, but spending a little less time having fun now will pay huge dividends later.  Remember to focus on you more even if it sounds extremely vain, because true friends will always be there for you later. Learn to be humble, and to roll with the punches.  And most important of all, make sure to slow down and take it all in. A time will come, very soon I might add, when you\u2019ll wish you had these high school problems that seem so monumental right now.  So learn to multitask right now. Hit the books, have fun, but always take the time to stop and smell the roses. Good Luck.",
                "Nicole": "The advice I would give myself is, pay more attention in class. The things that were taught are brought up in college and it would be beyond helpful to remember them. Not only would paying attention help, but also, doing well in all of my classes. If I would have done extremely well, my grade point average would have been higher and that would've helped me earn more scholarship money. All in all, high school may seem like a joke when you're in it, but if you want to succeed and make college a little bit more easier for yourself, do very well and pay alot of attention to the \"nonsense\" you once thought it all was.",
                "Joel ": "At college I have learned many valuable skills and life lessons through close friends, professors and faculty. I have also matured a great deal. While other kids were partying I spent time in the library studying or doing study groups with other students. College has been good for me socially. I network with many different types of people and have made life long friends. Although I thought a professor was mean to me, she believed in me and pushed me to succeed, which has only strengthened my drive to succeed and earn my degree. Her class improved my writing skills. She taught me that communication with professors is key to success. College has also taught me the value of time management skills. In life you must learn to balance work and play. If you do not and have too much of one or the other you set yourself up for failure. It has been worthwhile for me to attend because I know how it is to work and go to school for something you love. I am determined to earn a degree for myself and my future family. Education is the gateway to anything I can possibly imagine.",
                "mariangie ": "What have I gotten out of the college experience that is/has been valuable?  Well I gained a lot from college over the years.  To first that is off that education is vital and important for ones life.  Eduction feeds your mind and keeps your brain functioning.  Another value that I got out of college is the experience that I have obtained with interaction with classmates and teacher, it has provided a level of communication of similar interests.  Another value that I have obtain from college is the knowledge that I get from each course that i attend.  I learn more and more which I have run into time to time in my personal life.  College has given me so much knowledge that I am aware and I am open to much more things in what this world can offer.  Most importantly like i mentioned earlier is that continuing on to eduction in college does really keep you mind active and young.  Learning is food to your brain.  These are some of the valuable things that college has given me since i have attended.",
                "Clarissa ": "My college experience has allowed me to gain a positive perspective on the importance of time management. In high school, I was the extrovert who explored all the extra-curricular activities which were presented to me. However, with a heavy work load, feelings of being overwhelmed, and pulled in many directions arose; I maintained focus, managed my time and was satisfied with the effort I put forth.  When I began college I paced myself, focused on my studies, all the while preparing to give birth to my first child. It was then that I began to realize that time management was going to be an essential tool in successfully completing my degree. Ready to take on what I expected to be the most challenging semester I would ever endure, I went for it. Managing my course load, work, and family for the first time in my college career, I was forced to be extremely time conscious. When the semester was over, maximizing my time made me eligible for the dean\u2019s list for the very first time. In the end, what I thought would be one of my biggest challenges, turned out to be one of my greatest accomplishments.",
                "Natasha ": "As a undergraduate student  here at Holy Family University, I have experienced numerous things. My overall experience has been a blessing for I have met some wonderful people. Holy Family has opened my eyes to diversity on a very large scale. I have been in contact with students from overseas, students with different religious backgrounds, and students with disabilities thriving together doing things they love to do. For example, there was a Halloween dance where I had the oppertunity to dance with someone in a wheelchair and actually ejoy myself. However, the most i have gotten out of my college experience is strength and determination. I received these two things from the environment, which consist of staff and peers. There is always someoone to give me the extra push in the right direction and reminding me that i can do all that I put my mind to. These experiences are valuable to me because they are life lessons that no matter where I am in life i will be  able to cooperate. I will be able to cooperate because it is an environment I have already been subjected to and overcame and in overcoming i became unstoppable.",

Originally, I was supposed to attend another school and live away from home but, at the last minute, I changed my mind. I am beyond happy with my decision. I know that if I would have went away to school, I would not have done well. My mind would be foucused elsewhere and I would have been extremely distracted. Living at home has made me realize the person I want to become. Also, in these past few months attending Holy Family University, I have realized how important an education is to someone. Most people do not have the opportunity to recieve the education that I have recieved. I realized that my grades will make or break my future. A social life is not important right now as most college students think it is. I know I will always have time for fun when I graduate.  As of right now, school is my number one priority. I value my education more than anything in the world, mainly because it has helped me to grow up and become responsible along the way.",
                "Antonina ": "Holy Family University is a great school that I had a privilege to attend from the years of 2007 to 2011. This school gave me better outlook on life and taught me a lot about the healthcare field. The rigid grading system allowed me to set higher goals for myself and realize that I am an academically successful student.\n                 I pursue a degree in psychology, and over the last four years I was able to learn on campus as well gain experience in my field outside the school. Having the ability to visit and apply my knowledge in different hospitals in my area was a very rewarding experience. After I graduate this school I would like to help people who suffer with clinical depression as well as continue my education in the field of psychology eventually obtaining a Ph. D.",
                "David ": "What have I gotten out of my six years of attending two different colleges with three years still to go?  I have experienced almost everything that college has to offer including outrageous loans.  I experienced living away for those years at Penn State and how important it is to have self-control with my independence.  I have experienced academic victories as well as some major defeats.  I have learned the ways of how colleges milk every last penny out of a vulnerable student who doesn\u2019t know any better.  When I transferred from Penn State to Holy Family University is when I realized how valuable college can be.  I went from a student who was carelessness and ignorant, to a student who finally understands what college is all about.  College is extremely valuable to me now because I have learned what happens if you make the wrong choice of a major.   I have seen what happened to friends who make the wrong decisions in college.   I realize how important college really is to set the whole rest of your life in motion.  I value the things that college has taught me about life outside as well as inside the classroom."

It has great surrounding to where it is not too loud and is a closed off campus where when you enter there is a gate with a security guard who, if you do not have a student ID or parking pass, will check ID'S before letting people in. The food is okay but i would say try to get a letter or something to avoid paying money for a meal plan because the only thing that is really good is the breakfast, everything else isn't as good. It will also save you money if you do not have a meal plan. For the housing i have my own room as i already had 2 bad roommates though it took them until my last semester of my Sophomore year to get me my own room, it still got done in a timely manner. Usually the single rooms are taken by the upper classes (Seniors and graduate students), but you can always ask to be on the single room wait list, in which, they would let you know over the summer if a room or something has opened up."

I'd probably roll my eyes at myself because \"being an adult is a long way from now\". I never followed anyone's advice because I felt that I knew better. I'd be a tough nut to crack but, it wouldn't be an impossible task. The only reason I refused to grow up was because I was afraid. I didn't think I'd be able to handle the \"cold world out there\" that everyone spoke of. I'd give it to myself straight and say, \"it's time to let go of mom and dad's hand, and start walking on your own. There will be times when you think you aren't cut out for this but, tune out the doubt and the fear. It will only hold you back. It's okay to be scared, life is scary but you aren't alone. You have a loving family and friends that are rooting for you. You must believe that have the power to achieve your dreams because you do.\" I'd listen because nothing is impossible.",

This has allowed me to grow tremendously as a student and as a person helping to become a more efficient person who works smarter not harder. I have learned that a situation must never be looked at in a one dimension perspective because the situation at-hand is always multi-causal and in order to come up with a solution to a problem one must look at all the factors contributing to the situation to determine the best way to proceed. Most importantly I have learned to be a confident, independant person who believes in themselves and their abilities.  In doing so, I have learned that asking for help is never a show of weakness but one of strength because it takes strength to admit that one does not have all the answers. It has inspired me to share my beliefs and values with others in a more open and honest way without fear.  Since I know that even if they disagree with me they will not see me as any less of a person. I guess one could say that I have begun to learn who I am.",

When President Obama spoke about black fathers needing to step up in the lives of their children, and in the homes around America on Father\u2019s Day 2008, I could not have agreed more. I knew that if I felt so passionate about the role of families, this is where I wanted to focus my time and skill. I want to receive my masters in counseling psychology and go on to get licensed as a marriage and family therapist. \nI know firsthand what its like to be fatherless, and how that type of influence can shape a person, but I had extended family to pick up where he was missing out.

I can carry my education with me where ever I go and also experience things that expand my learning. I feel it was valuable to attend college because I have learned so much about myself and also I am able to contribute my thoughts and learning to society.  Had I not gone to college, I feel I would have been doing a disservice to myself. The way the economy is going, jobs are not promised and positions are not nearly as secure as they were years ago.

Along with that make sure you open yourself up to new experiences and new people. Don't be afraid to jump out of your comfort zone and meet new friends. You only get one chance to go to college in your lifetime and make the best out of it. The age you're at now may be the most important time of your life, in terms of shaping your future and building relationships so be sure to choose wisely who you suround yourself with.

Open up, join some study groups, get mentally and physically strong and you will be able to tackle this like you will getting over the death of your parents. Remember, our parents are extremely proud of us for doing so well,  and although I cannot tell you when tragedy will strike; \"all the while thinking in my mind, 2 loving family members will pass in a very short time, and that mental strongness will be needed then more than ever.\" Alright, I've taken enough time, that statistics book is starting to turn green and you are slowly falling asleep as I ramble.

You want to be a firefighter and improve upon public safety.  Move up to San Luis Obispo asap, you'll love it there. Go to Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria (Santa Maria sucks, but the community college is great) and take out loans/ apply for financial aid, you're gonna need it. Make a detailed plan of classes needed for getting Associates degrees in Fire, EMS, and Psychology while getting your transfer requirements done. All of these have a lot of classes in common, so they won't take to long. Try to make a time frame of less than three years for Community College and work on an ambulance if possible. Next transfer to Cal Poly SLO, Major in Psychology, travel abroad and learn spanish. Once you're B.S. is complete get Paramedic licensed and get your MPA. By this time you should have a job, be moving up in the fire department and have gotten there years earlier than me. Be open to new things and have fun!",

Also, i would tell myself to ask more questions, dont be afraid. I would have rather I know too much then not enough. College is a place where im going to prepare myself for my future. I would also say, its okay if you want to go to a 2 year communtiy college so you can discover what you want to do in life. Its okay to sometimes be unsure, life will eventually fall into it's place.",

Overall, with all the advice that I could give I don't think I would becasue I am quiet happy with the way things turned out.  I wouldn't be the person I am today without learning from those mistakes and growing from them.",

I would for one tell myself to put in for all of the scholarships that i possibly could. Scholarships are really important and back in highschool i did not realize it. I also would tell myself to start saving oney for college back then. Another type of advice i would tell myself would be to know what i really want to do before i start college and know what my major is about and put my whole heart and soul into it. I would say to really loook at your future and plan it out so you do not have to do it when you are graduating and have a ton of loans to pay back. That is what i would tell myself if i got to go back in time to my senior year.",

You're the type of person who likes to meet new people. You should try to get your grades up in the first year so that you can transfer and meet other people. There's other things to concern yourself with in college, for example your grades, but if your uncomfortable with your setting, you probably won't want to be there or try hard.",
                "Darryll ": "I would tell myself that grades are not just letters, they determine your future, and what options you have. I would tell myself not to give up or get discouraged, that I should try and put as much effort into school as I possibly can. I would also tell myself to visit colleges and make sure that I knew what all of my options were before choosing. I would have told myself that the social scene in high school is only temporary, that once your in college things will be different, to focus more on school work, because the social scene won't follow you after graduation, but your GPA will.",
                "Sara ": "First of all, I would tell myself that everyone needs some time management training before entering college. There is no way around it and even if you think you are prepared, you are not. Along those lines, remember to pace yourself. Do not leave everything till the last minute nor take on too many classes, activities, jobs, etc. Overdoing things can really hamper your grades and life in general, though you do not want to do too little because you will not be prepared when you graduate college. Additionally, in college the teachers will help you if necessary but it is the responsibility of the student to let them know if there is trouble with something, just as doing the work and showing up to class is the student's responsibility. If you do not have any drive to be in school then you will not succeed because too much responsibility is placed on yourself, and essentially you will be wasting your money.  You do not need to know what you want to do with your life (a lot of students do not know either and some that do will change their major later on), however you do need drive.",
                "Jacob ": "I would have to say that college is the best experience I have went through yet in life, although I have made some bad decisions while in college.  The decisions I made were not the best and hurt me in the long run, the attitude I had when I entered college, was that it was much easier than high school, and I could attend class when I wanted.  Well, I was all wrong, and learnt the hard way.  I had to pick up the pieces and work twice as hard in order to pick up my GPA, grades, and my great reputation that I once had.  You have to work hard in order to make it through college and follow what major you want.  Do not be scared to change majors, if you do not feel the current one is right, then move onto something you like more.",
                "Ellen ": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a highschool senior I would tell myself to not be so focused  on people trying to bring you down or thinking you will never go anywhere. I would tell myself to focus on school and study a lot because there will be a lot of that in college. I would say to always believe in yourself no matter what anyone tells you. If you have a dream then you need to make it happen no matter what. If there is something you are passionate about, work hard, go through with it and you'll be very happy with the outcome. Never hold back because people are trying to bring you down. You need to rise above that and trust your insticts because you know yourself better than anyone else. You need to strive for success. Never live your life for someone else, live it for yourself.  Do what it is you want to do and what you want out of life, not what someone else wants you to do. In May I will recieve my Associates in Visual Art. I proved everyone wrong who never believed in me.",
                "Kristen ": "If I could go back in time to when I was a high school senior I would tell myself to always take as many challenging courses as possible, to contunuesly work hard because it is always worth it in the end. I would also tell myself to do certain things for myself becuase you can not please everyone, and that it is important to do the things that make you happy.  I would just tell myself that there is always a reason why your teacher is telling you something that you think is not important at the time.  The most important thing you can do is to always work hard and to do things to the best of your ability.",
                "Aaron ": "Aaron. In 8 years you're going to wish that you had known this. It would make things a lot easier in the future. 1) STUDY. Those grades will make it easier for you to get a better degree (aka more money). 2) PUT THE ALCOHOL DOWN AND SAVE YOUR MONEY. You'll want that money for more exciting things to happen in Hollywood. 3) BE NICE TO YOUR FAMILY. There will be times in the future where you will need their help. Although they love you, you don't show it as much. 4) BE THANKFUL. You'll meet and lose a couple friends along your way. Life IS short, don't take them for granted. 5) TRY. Depression is a horrible thing. But if that energy spent reflecting could be directed towards something else, hard telling what you can do! A lot of your mistakes, misfortune and overall lessons learned are normal. Don't let them get to you too much. You only live once (as far as we know).... enjoy it. Be.... Happy. Oh, and hey. You'll meet a girl in MN. Be nice to her. Trust me. You'll regret it otherwise.",

With so many different career paths it can be difficult to choose just one! Keep in mind that one can minor in a subject. For example one can minor in Spanish and major in Communications. It makes sense to minor in a subject that can be helpful for your major. Secondly, I would tell myself to do some research on student loans and how to apply for scholarships. Trying to get financial aid, a student loan, or a scholarship can be very difficult, so do not be afraid to ask questions! Use your resources, go online, use the telephone, talk to diffent professors. Remember to not rush through college, and focus as much as you can on school, four years will go by fast! I would also tell myself to not forget about Study abroad, Internships, and Graduate school. And lastly, don't forget to have fun!",

The professors are all nice and polite, they always is away to get in contact of them if need any help on something in the class. There is also a lot different off of school activities to on school activities from clubs, activities, gatherings. I would recommend this college to somebody if they were looking for that Aloha feeling or them island vibes of going to a college in the Hawaiian Islands"

It isn't the most amazing school with new cool features, but it's a simple straightforward college.  Honolulu Community College still has much more expanding to do, but they do with what they have. They have activities to participate in, groups to join, and opportunities to take every so often. The food and location is decent. It's a small college so there aren't too many people, but enough to find friends or have people to talk to. I've haven't attended any other colleges, but Honolulu Community College isn't a terrible place to go to.  This is my overall opinion of Honolulu Community College."

                "Alice": "Back in high school I was a little above average kind of student. So if I could go back to the past to give myself an advice,\nthe school related advice I would've told myself would be to have taken certain classes more seriously rather than just getting by just to finish school and get a good grade. With that I would've also told myself to not give up, no matter how hard the class was, that all it took was more study time.  I would have also told myself to practice improving my study habits, to go out less and use that time wisely to study because after high school, the social life isn't as important as school. \nLastly, I would've also told myself to save money sooner, listen to my Geometry teacher who told me to open an account on ING Direct, I should've followed through earlier! But besides all that, I would also encourage myself to continue caring for school, never take a break.",
                "Jessica ": "I graduated from high school a year early, so there is a lot of advice I would give myself. First of all, apply for colleges early; deadlines are a huge thing that gets prospective students. I started to look for colleges in my junior year, only to found out that this year was also going to be my senior year.  I was hesitant to apply for some colleges because of the application fee, too; do not let those discourage you.  Also, look for scholarships and grants. Usually, you will not find scholarships where you do not have to work for them; things worth having do not come easily. If you want something, you need to go out and work for it; it will not just be given to you. I am a student paying for college by myself, so this process in furthering my education will not come easily. A good thing to remember is that college is the best investment you'll ever make, so make the most of it."

There is not as much activity on campus as you would see in bigger schools, but this is not a priority for me personally. My favorite part about Hood is their small class sizes. My largest class last semester had maybe thirty students! This really allows the student to learn to the best of their ability. All of the professors I have had really care about their students, and will even provide opportunities for you off campus. My advisor is also incredible! As a student who works nearly full time during the semester and has a lot of restrictions to my schedule, having an advisor that remembers me, and can recall our past conversations is really important. Hood really cares about their students, and it shows!"

By far, Hood has been my favorite college experience.\n\nThe college is relatively small compared to nearby campuses. I can reliably walk from one corner of Hood's campus to the other in 10 minutes, and it's amazingly close to the downtown Frederick area nearby. For commuters, there is ample parking both on-campus and on the streets around campus. \n\nThis school is designed for commuters looking for the level of education found at large residential colleges. There is one residential building on Hood's campus, but it does not hold many people and tends to be reserved for out-of-state students. There is a small dining hall and campus center, with couches for socializing (and sometimes sleeping) and a bookstore. \n\nThe education (at least in the Business Department, where I spend most of my time) is fantastic. With high school like class sizes of 20-30 people, the professors here make it a point to get to know you. The professors are also very experienced in their respective fields, and often bring that experience into the classroom. Oh, and have I mentioned that we have a classroom that doubles as a stock trading room? \n\nIf you live with your parents or in your own apartment and want a hands-on education, this commuter school is for you.

They also have given me an opportunity to be a research assistant over the summer. However, I would caution music students: the music department is small and the practice rooms, while large, are largely neglected and I have found dead bugs on the pianos when I've gone there to practice. The door to the practice studios is sometimes left swinging on its hinges. Just a warning."

I wish I could say I was surprised that me and 24 others got food poisoning from both the dining hall and cafe here on campus... however I have several pictures of raw chicken, moldy Alfredo sauce, and cooks not changing their gloves when switching from station to station.  This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened... hell we got shut down by the health department last year because there were full Ecoli cultures in the tins of sauces for the pasta station.  This school has a food sanitation issue big time, mostly because Hood hires just about anyone who has remote cooking experience.  Perhaps if they paid their employees better and was overall a better work environment they wouldn\u2019t have to be desperate for cooks and all of this could be avoided.  I have a friend who works there for work study and they vow that no one should ever eat there... they stopped eating there since working there.  Hood needs to fix this before word gets out...  it would be a shame if the Frederick News Post got word of this."

I would tell my self that the Hills Scholars program will be the best experience ever. It will open many doors you never thought existed and you will grow so much as an individual. Once you graduate from the program, take off a couple years to save money for the four-year institution. Scholarships and grants are great but they will only cover educational expenses and they are not as easy to come by as everyone says. The extra cash will come handy once you start school again; you can work less and concentrate more on your education. By doing this you will also have time to experience the college life and make new connections. You will be able to volunteer and explore interests and most importantly, you will be able to keep up with your studies.

In fact, we are roommates again this year (my sophomore year). I would tell my past self this simple message because it applies to everything. I have always worked hard in school. Academics mean a lot to me. I know that furthering my education is one of the best investments I will ever make. By telling myself that everything will work out, I'm not only giving my former self peace of mind for the worries at that moment, including the roommate stress, but also any other worries that arise later. I am a firm believer in the thought that everything happens for a reason. As long as I work as hard as I can and put forth my best effort, everything will work out someway somehow.

That was a major problem when i first began college classes, and as a result, my gpa went down for a bit. \nMy current habit, taking what i need to do, and spreading it out over the time i have, is helping me stay on task, and helping me bring my grades up. If i had done that at the beginning of my college career, my grades would have been higher, and i would have been able to enjoy more of my collge experience without stress, as well as get more financial assistance. That's why I would advise my past self to not procrastinate, and be more proactive with my education.",

Therefore, if I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior, I would definitely say do not simply take senior year as a joke. With all that is within you, avoid \"senior-itis\" and whatever you do, DO NOT wait until the last minute to apply for college. By doing so, you put yourself in harms way of missing application deadlines and falling behind in the college process. It is imperative that you try your very best from the moment that you become a senior to the moment when you graduate because believe it or not, your senior year does not go overlooked. It's alright to have some fun, for after all, it is your senior year, but do not lack on applying for scholarships. You do not want to wait until the last minute when your money is due, to realize that you do not have enough and that you should've applied for scholarships all along while still having fun.

Coming to college on your own is a big step in your life of being a youg adult, you have to trmember that no one is going to be behind you reminding you that you have a papaper due next week or that you need to study for your test on Friday.

But most of all, I would want my high school senior to know that the freshman year of college is going to be awkward and weird, no matter what. No matter what, you go into college with some sort of expectation, and more often than not the reality it not going to match up. You're going to make friends in the first week that you'll think you'll love forever, who you won't even talk to by the end of the year. You and your roommate might get along, and more likely you won't, and that's okay. Making friend who you really want to keep around takes time, so don't rush that process.

I never realized how axious I would get when trying to talk to new people. It has never come easy for me, but talking to new people at college was the hardest thing. I assume it was because I knew I was going to be with these people for four years and I was so afriad of what they would think of me.  For the first three months of my freshmen year, I mostly went to class and sat in my room, too afraid to talk to anyone, longing for the past. Then I was asked by someone who lived in my hall to go to karaoke. Saying yes to that was the best decision of my life. Was I scared and anxious? Of course. But the people I met there turned out to be the best friends I could have ever asked for. I learned that, if you want something, you have to work for it and go get it, and that you can't sit back and wait for it.",

I felt like i wasted my junior and senior year taking extra classes that didn't really help me with college. If i attended the program, I would have a certificate of some sort and by now, I could be working with that certificate. I need a certificate where I can work in a hospital becasue that will allow me to experience working in the medical field. Experiences like this could really help me grow as a student and open doors to more opportunites. I learned that the graduate schools or programs I want to get into after my undergraduate school requires a large amount of hours from working in fields related to health and medical. Another thing I regret about is not taking my AP classes' exams. I didn't bother trying my best in the classes and I didn't take the exams seriously. If i have taken them more serious, I would have been able to skip some courses in college.",

It is not a good idea to drop out because it could make it hard to find a job and if you do find one it is not one that you would want to be on for the rest of your life.  You plan on having kids I know you would want to have a good foundation for you and you children so you don't have to struggle to take care of them on minimum wage jobs that can barely take care of you. Finishing high school is a good head start towards your future and you will regret dropping out in the long run it is not worth it, and you must remember you have to stay focused on your goals and not what is going on in the world right now.",

There are so many resources out there, just take my time and look. Free money is fabulous and loans are nothing but a quick fix and one day, I'm going to have to pay that back and it's not going to be any fun!\n\nI would also tell myself that classes are more important than any parties. Not only that, but it is very important to get to know my classmates and find the studious ones who can become study partners. There's nothing wrong with partner studying, or group studying because you can bounce ideas off each other. That makes it so you can bring the material up in everyday conversations and you're learning and retaining information without recognizing that you're just studying. \n\nFinally, I would tell myself to never procrastinate because my best work comes from taking my time and rereading what I wrote.

I moved out of the house at 18 years old to live with my boyfriend. I have to say my boyfriend give me a new life and with that new life I found myself finishing high school and moved on to college because of him pushing me and to never giving up.. \"You\u2019re smart\" he told me. I wish I had someone to motivate me like my boyfriend did throughout high school. My family never did. I went through a hard time with high school kids picking on me because I could not speak right and I had a learning disability.  If I could go back to high school and learn again I would because I would feel that I'm at the same place with those kids, not because of age but because I am smart.",
                "Mareca": "If I could go back to old high school me I would be sure to tell myself to keep an open mind. College is filled with people coming from different cultures and backgrounds. If one comes close minded you miss out on opputunities that could possibly change their life. One may also miss out on possibly meeting and developing relationships with potential life-long friends. if one comes into college with an open mind then they will have a better college experience. Collge is definitely  about lerning and recieving a degree, but it is alos about learning lessons, trying new things and finding one self. College can be overwhelming at times, so one should definetly make sure they take time away from the research papers to relax and talk a walk or hang out with friends. College can be alot,but going in with an open and willling mindset makes college more enjoyable.",

As a growing adult, I've come to realize that the world is fast changing and ever expanding. Knowing this now, I would tell my past self work harder towards everything and to make myself a more well-rounded person. Instead of focusing on the subjects and things I'm already good at, I would tell myself to focus on the things and subjects I'm weak in. I would tell this to my past self because it would help me prepare for the tough world ahead. If I had worked harder to be a more well-rounded person, it would have made adapting to a new life much easier.",

Look at you, I remember sitting in that table studying SAT vocabularies until midnight every day. Well, I am sorry to tell you that I am attending Hood College instead of UPenn. Which one is Hood College? The one near aunt's house that you never think you will go to. I love the life I am having right now and I am making the best out of it; nevertheless, I do not know if attending another school on your dream school list would be better or not. As much as I love Hood, I think you should go to a more challenging school. I strongly suggest you make more effort. Finish your application as soon as possible. Apply for as many scholarships as you can. Do not procrastinate. Do not give up. Le, think about your future and your family; try harder and harder. Remember your favorite Vietnamese saying, \"Hard times come before success.\"",

College IS an option for you!\u201d I would have encouraged me to have faith in myself and to avoid the errant the path that was my legacy. I would teach myself to listen to the voice inside that tried to encourage me to find the fortitude to branch out and create my own path; the one that could lead to an education.  I would have emboldened myself to try even when I was told I would fail. I would have already taught myself not to be discouraged if I did fail, because there IS dignity and triumph in the attempt.  \nLastly, I would have told myself to apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible.  The worse they can do to you is tell you no. Try.",

                "Rupa": "The best advice I would give myself if I was a high school senior again would be to take a lot  Advance Placement tests. This is because a lot of the general education requirements in college can be obtained through the AP tests. You should expose yourself to different types of classes so that it is easier to determine your major.  I would also tell myself to get involved in more extra-curricular activities  to show that you are well rounded. Being confident is very important and that you should follow your dreams and goals, not compare yourself to others and work at your own pace because we are all engineered differently.  Make good friends that will help and guide you in the right direction and will support and not judge or manipulate you. You are responsible for yourself, do not expect that someone else will be able to help or give you the answers. Always think before you speak or get involved because your words make up your actions and character. Make good connections/impressions with your teachers and counselors because they impact your college process.",

You may get stressed enough to dream you go to school naked but you won't do it, not once.  I promise.  \nYou\u2019ll make some bad choices but they\u2019ll be fixable and your chemistry professor will like his new shirt better than the old one.  \nSpeaking of choosing, pick a few good friends and when things get tough you\u2019ll look over to see them running beside you.  \nEven with friends around, you\u2019ll feel alone sometimes, everyone does, but home is just a phone call away and moms send brownies to the downhearted.\nAccept that you're going to make some mistakes.  Life isn\u2019t written in permanent marker except for that spot on your dorm wall and they\u2019ll paint over that.    \nGrades aren\u2019t everything either.  Take time to have fun, run for charity, laugh with friends but every time you get behind the wheel of a car be sure you're awake and sober.\nAnd know that after college, no one cares about SAT\u2019s anymore.",
                "Francie": "If I could go back in time and give my high school self some advice, I would tell myself to value my education more. Back in high school, I was a big time slacker who would skip classes, and not worry about my academics. I only did enough work to get by and this resulted in having to attend Community College to raise my GPA because no 4 year school would accept me. I would also advice myself to be more involved within my community and classmates. I was pretty much the loner type, and while many of my high school peers still keep in contact with eachother, I have found it difficult to maintain relationships with my high school peers because I was rarely involved with my peers or school activities. I did not even go to prom or senior dinner. Now that I am in College, I see how important it is to be part of a community and to help others in need. So if I could go back, I would advice myself to do volunteer work since it helps one become a better rounded person and one can use such experiences for future careers.",

                "Kala": "If I were able to go back in time and give my high school self advice about making the transitions to college there are several things I would want myself to know. First I would tell myself to make an effort to make friends and get involved. I was so focused on academics that I missed out on what could have been incredible opportunities to meet new people and have new experiences. The second thing that I wold tell myself is to loosen up and not take everything so seriously. I spent my first semester entirely focused on grades and got myself so stressed out over it that I didn't really enjoy the classes I was taking. I would tell myself that this is a time to experiment. Try new things withouth worrying about what people will think of you or what could go wrong. I would encourage myself to enjoy college. My first year has gone by so quickly, I would tell myself to make the most of every moment. Most importantly I would say have fun in school, take chances, and have no regrets.",
                "Kimberlee": "Choose your friends wisely and pick classes based on your interests or major. Even if it is a class that you need for your major (or graduation requirement), but you don't really like it, tough it out. If you need to take it then don't waste your time or money registering for a class that you wont attend whether or not you like it.",
                "Christine": "I would tell myself not to rush into finding the perfect college. I would advise taking some time off and finding out what it is that I want to do and what I value in my future and education. The decisions you make about your education really matter in many more ways then just picking a major. Where your located and who your with will in the end make a much bigger difference then all the classes you take. I would tell myself that college is about a lot more than a piece of paper, it's an experience that will change who you are and the road you travel.",
                "Nicole": "If I were able to speak to myself as a high school student knowing what I know now, I would tell myself not to take anything for granted and to enjoy myself.  High School is a time to have fun, not have a job, hang out with your freinds, really discover who you are as a person.  In high school, this is something I would remind myself of.  I would tell myself not to be so wrapped up in what I have going on outside of school, but to enjoy the time I get to spend with teachers who really care about you and make the freinds you will have for the rest of your life.  Enjoy yourself, your never getting these days back and as soon as you step into the world outside of high school, your going to give anything to go back.  So make each day one your going to remember.  Most importantly, think about the future but not to far, just far enough so you have an idea of whats coming and be ready for it.",
                "Nathaniel": "I would simply tell my high school self to give his all in his first year. I would tell him it is imperative to give 100% of his efforts to everything, even those things he thinks are unimportant. This quality is invaluable and will not only get him a high GPA but also higher admiration among his peers and potential employers. This is the only advice I could give for all the choices he has made thus far, even mistakes, are important to make him into the man I am today. It is important to gain such new experiences and to go into them without knowing the outcome or some plan. The ignorance of the path ahead is exactly what will make him strong once he traverses its treacherous waters.",
                "Theresa": "Some say the first week of college for freshman is the hardest week due to the change in homework, new friends, hours of free time, no parents, and most importantly all the peer pressure. It takes a lot from a person, especially me to admit that in the beginning I was scared and nervous that I wasn\u2019t going to make it, or allow myself to open up to new people.  \nThe nights leading up to college, I was told many different stories from past friends who graduated from college. Telling me that I have nothing to worry about because I am a person who is outgoing, and my personality is one that no one else has. \u201cWhat a confidence booster,\u201d I thought. However, pulling up to campus I told my older sister Jess that personality only gets you so far and nerves stay with you forever. What was I going to do? Do I change who I am to fit in so people will like me, or do I act like my outgoing self and make friends similar to me?  Finally the advice i would have given myself would have been along the lines of \" Just be yourself  T\"!",

I would also tell myself not to listen to what my parents say I have to do. To choose the college I want to go to instead of settling and only applying to one. Applying to many, and actually going to and looking at different colleges would be a good idea. With the sacrifices, grades, and extra curriculars that I did in high school I could pick almost any college to go to. However, I'd tell myself not to worry that everything will eventually work out in the end, no worries",
                "Cory": "I would tell myself, to wake up and get higher than a C average. Why? because, in the near future you will have a hard time getting into college and countless hours of hard work to find scholarships and grants that could have been given to you if you actually payed attention in high school.",
                "nicole": "I would have told myself to do better in high school. Also I would have done better in community college before I transfered. I love college now as an \"older\" student. It took me a long time to get through school but it is the right time for me now. I just wish I would have done better because it was a lot easier then and I took that for granted. College is a gift that many people do not have the opportunity to go to or the patience to be in. I am grateful that I am in college now and doing as well as I am. It is hard to look into the future when you are younger but I should have told myself to really find out what I want to do and where I saw myself.",
                "Amanda": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior I would emphisize the impportance of keeping up my grades so that I maintained a higher GPA, also I would tell myself to keep all ongoing art projects from my different art classes I took in high school so that when I was appling for colleges I would have a better portfolio and a progress chart to show how my skills have increased over the years. Going back I would also tell myself to start appling for as many scholarships and outside aid that I can get as well as start saving up as much as I can during high school so that I would have more money to pay for my college, because my parents are not in a financial place to support me and now I am in a place where I have no idea how I am going to afford this education.",

I would however, tell myself to search for new study methods ahead of time because when I got here I would see that some of the old methods are just that...old methods.  I would also say to reach out a little more and have fun. I have well disciplined myself but a little fun can't be too bad.",
                "jesus": "Looking back on my senior year, perhaps my biggest regret is not focusing on school or participating in more senior activities. Back then my goals were completely different and the idea of attending my dream college was almost completely out of question. I spent time doing other things that were not school related. If given the chance I would like to go back and motivate myself into doing more scholarly activities. \n          I would have enjoyed participating in study groups or working on senior projects, attending home coming games or senior breakfast. Instead I spent time working on cars. Which don't get me wrong, I still love doing, but if given the chance I would have chosen a different road. One that would prepare me for college life. Making sure to take the SAT on time, and enroll in classes that would help my college career. I often times see people that graduated with me, they chose other paths that led them to success sooner, though I am proud of what I\u2019ve done so far, I wish it would have came sooner.",
                "Crystal": "I would probably try to calm myself down. I was very nervous about the college experience. I am the first person in my family to go to college. So no one had advice for me. I would tell myself that I am strong and that everything will work out perfect.",
                "Kara": "There are many things that I wish I could go back in time and tell myself as a high school senior. The first thing I would tell myself is to do as many extracurricular and volunteer activities as possible because colleges and scholarship foundations love students with a purpose. The second thing I would tell myself is that no scholarship is too small to apply for. Fill out every scholarship form until you can't find any more to apply to. Next, I would tell myself to take some of the required pre-requisites for my degree while still in high school (e.g. Writing 101 and Math 151). This would have allowed me to complete my associate's degree much more quickly and it would have better prepared me for the transition from high school to college.  Lastly, and most importantly,  I would tell myself to save as much money as I could to help finance my education. College is expensive so any savings would have made paying for college so much easier.",
                "Reginald": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior knowing all the things I know about college life I would tell myself to apply for more scholarships because college is not cheap. With the part of making the transition I would tell myself to make sure I manage my time wisely and dont procrastinate on any work. Knowing what I know now I would give the senior me the advice to know what my career choice or major will be so he will be able to focus on what he wants to become and not switch majors like most college students do. Being that college life and college itself is very expensive I would tell my younger self that he would need to make sure that he has money for any unexpected situation that might come up becasue you always run into a problem with financial aid.",
                "Samantha": "If I could go back in time and tell myself that everything takes time. It takes time getting used to the rigor of college life and learning to make friends. I would also tell myself that joining clubs and activities is an important part of succeeding in college. I would also tell myself that it is important to study so that I can achieve good grades. It also helps relieve stress when I am prepared for tests and exams. I would also tell myself that change is good, even if it doesn't seem like it at first.",
                "Danae": "There are certainly a few things I wish I could tell my \u201chigh school self\u201d about college. I would tell myself to save my money before going to college. When I was in high school, I did not understand the concept of paying for tuition, books, gas, etc, so I would definitely forewarn myself about the stress of college debt. Although I have always been good with time management, I would tell myself to be more disciplined before college. It is always so hard to be responsible and do homework before hanging out with friends, and that was a hard lesson to learn when entering college. The last thing I would mention is to work on confidence. I did not know many people when I entered college, so learning to be more outgoing was a hard transition. If I would have known these things before entering college, I think it would have been an easier experience.",

The prospect of transitioning into college life terrifies you - I know, because I was once you!  Hear me out...\n\nSecret #1: As a fact of life, transitions are hard (this is true in every aspect of existance...remember how tough adolescence was?) - but that doesn't mean they are filled with impending doom! No! Transitions are excellent opportunities for developing character traits like perserverence through discord, patience with the process of adjustment, and faith in your self-efficacy. \n\nSecret #2: Though transitions are hard, college isn't. So many students get overwhelmed by the idea of homework and papers and exams and research that they psych themselves out! Yes, you're going to have to do all of those things... but class participation, diligent study and a propensity for asking questions will make it do-able - even enjoyable!\n\nSecret #3: Don't worry about the future.  You've got the tenacity and capability to acheive any goal, so go with the flow a little! Let life show you all it has to offer: the good, the bad, and of course those gray areas.  Carpe diem, beautiful girl!"

The College catalog lists a lot of courses that have not been offered in years according to not just the students, but the professors themselfs.",

The location is not too far from home, but yet, its not too close either. The students are very friendly, as well as the teachers. The sports teams are invigorating and fun, especially the long bus rides that we take every week. To speak on the food, it is delicious; it is better than any other cafeteria food that I have tried- and there is a ton of variety. All in all, Hood College is great. I cannot complain.",

The kitchen has been known not to listen to people with allergic needs (they've often served gluten to my friend who can't eat it), and they just generally don't seem to really care about what they're feeding their students. It's a step up from a high school cafeteria, but not by much.",

                "Keith ": "The most frustrating thing at our college is the administration.  They spend money on things that the majority of the student body doesn't need. Our administration is trying to get the college more money; therefore, they are offering free iPads to the incoming freshman class next year. \nAnother frustrating thing about our college is that the two types of students here are ones who have rich parents who can pay the tuition for them, and the ones who have worked hard in high school and are paying for college themselves.  Theupperclass doesn't seem to take their education seriously.",

Every semester I have had to go through the first week of classes with no books.  This is inconvenient because most classes begin serious coursework on the first day.  By the time I get my financial aid most of the used books are already gone from the bookstore, its too late to order them online, and I am a week behind on all of my readings.  It is extremely frustrating, and probably the worst part of my college experience.",

In high school, you're basically told that if you join all these clubs and get good grades, schools will fight to have you there...don't even worry about money! Of course, once reality set in, you apply for college and they want to make sure they havve your bank accounts on lock down for the rest of your life. It is beyond furstrating.",

The faculty and staff are actually involved in this process--the incoming freshmen are not taught about these traditions, leading to them disappearing.",

Vegetarians beware: you will be eating a lot of salad, because nine times out of ten the food isn't that great to begin with and the vegetarian option is usually subpar. Keep in mind, though, you won't be alone! A lot of people choose to eat at the campus center over the dining hall because the food is so much better, or use a lot of their spending money on groceries and cook for themselves.",

We are not required to attend chapel services, which also helps make the school open to any and all students. The school has many facilities to help students achieve including a success center that helps with time management and disabilities as well as psychological services for students who are struggling in other ways. Teachers are often available, even if it means an email, and are wonderful resources as well. Hope College is a great place to be and I absolutely have loved my time here so far."

However, Hope is not for everyone as it is a Christian college and can be very conservative at times. The student body and faculty are more liberal than the college policies represent, because the donors are a huge influence. Hope students are often genuine, kind, and extremely intentional about everything they partake in. It's a great place with great academics, but one should be aware of the social issues gong in."

The class sizes are on the small side, so the professors know your name and put in the extra effort to make sure each student is understanding the subject matter. It's very easy to get in touch with professors outside of the classroom which is very helpful. The school is very generous and offers many opportunities that are already paid for (i.e. a trip to Las Vegas). With such a small student body, there are many opportunities to find that'll look great on your resume. "

As far as academics go, the class sizes cannot be beat (smaller is so much better), and the professors are so amazing at what they do. They are always available by email and answer back quickly, or they are pretty much always available for a meeting. Although the school has about 3200 students, it still feels like there is so many people to meet! Social life in the beginning of the year is pretty lively, and then Greek rush happens during January where it can kind of taper off for open parties. If you want to continue partying second semester, rush!!! Overall, the campus feels very safe, and you can walk anywhere around it in about 5 minutes. Oh, and they just finished building the new beautiful Bultman student center to be open for this year! Go dutch!"

I had visited the college my senior year in high school and had loved every part of it, everything was so new, everyone was so nice, and I felt at home. A year at Hope College has definitely prepared me for the real world, back home everyone looked and thought like me. At Hope I came to understand that in the real world I would at often times be the only Latina in a room and would have to come to terms with the fact that people were openly homophobic, racist, or sexist. I had lived in a liberal bubble back home in California and Hope had burst it. "

If you identify as LGBTQIA+ Hope is not the right fit for you. If you are a minority student, Hope is not right for you, we have has racial slurs spoken to minority students. If you value education, real connection, and diversity do not attend Hope college. Do not make the mistake I have made. I am a very talkative junior here, and I literally only have 3 friends. I've joined student groups, and have met basically no one of any substance. Writing this depressed me because I wanted more than anything to learn, and have good friends, and at Hope I have found none of those things. "

                "Comment": "Overall Hope College is an excellent school but like anywhere it has its pitfalls. I'll be a sophomore in the fall and I'm very excited to get back into the thick of it all. While the school is affiliated with the Christian Reformed Church of America they don't really try to shove Christianity down your throat. The sports life is so so which I'm fine with but I'm sure there are many others who would like to see some changes in that area. The campus itself is safe but during my first semester we had some off-campus scares with shootings and assaults against female students both of which were investigated and taken care of to my knowledge. The biggest problem I had was with mice in the building which started in January and didn't end until I moved out of my hall in May. The Phys Plant needed to do something about it and never did beyond saying something along the lines of, \"Here's a mouse trap, good luck.\" The food is good but needs to be seasoned and becomes rather boring after a while. After midnight during the week there aren't a lot of options when it comes to dining unless you have a car and can go get fast food or whatever you can come up with in the kitchens of your res hall. They changed the dining hours last semester to make them more broad and available for more people but more flexible hours could be done honestly. Class sizes are great and if you put the effort in to get to know your professors they're some pretty amazing people. The TAs never really teach the class in my experience but they're always really helpful and good resources if they aren't busy and if the professor isn't on campus. Holland itself is adorable but after 11:00 p.m. it's pretty dead for minors. Holland is also kind of a tourist town so there are some great store but everything is a little overpriced. If you can't make it to Meijer the Minit Mart on 15th Street has a lot of snack food kind of stuff and things to make sandwiches if you're in a pinch."

What is unique about Hope was its smaller size and smaller class sizes which allows for more one on one time with professors, and also that it offers undergraduate research which is not offered at the big universities.

The lab and computer resources are abundant.  Professors are always willing to meet outside of class if you need assistance.

One thing I wish I had known and practiced before beginning college was scheduling and organizing time. Yes, you will definitely know when your classes are and, eventually, you will learn what time the Dining Hall opens but what about everything else that happens during the day? Do you have enough time to finish homework AND study well? Will you have time to form relationships with others in your dormitory and classes? Will you set time to relax and have fun? Making a weekly schedule helps to organize times for all of your daily activities. Obviously there will be slight deviations to go to orchestra concerts, homecoming or just hanging out with your friends (and that one guy friend you developed a liking for) but having a schedule will allow you to take control of your time. Additionally, your days will be so much less stressful and you will be able to obtain a decent amount of sleep.

College is expensive and if you are paying for it by yourself, you need to start making money. You will not have as much time as you think to work during school. Finding a temporary summer job is difficult. \nAgree on how you will communicate with your roommate and talk about other necessary agreements your first day. Practice good time management during the summer so you can swing right into it during the semester. Look at your schedule and figure out when you can have free time and when you need to study.

If I had joined all of the activities that I had signed up for at the Activities Fair at the beginning of orientation my transition into college would have been quite a lot easier.

Because the campus ministries here are not compulsory or overtly involved in every aspect of life at Hope, this has encouraged me to undertake ministry opportunities on my own.  The \"Christian character\" of Hope is not enforced but certainly encouraged, meaning students can believe whatever they want to believe.  The space that this policy leaves for spiritual growth has motivated me to pursue deep relationships with others, start a Bible study, pray for the student body, and take my academic pursuits seriously as belonging to the spiritual life.  The mixed atmosphere of Christian and secular culture has been a challenge at times, but I believe it has helped shape me into someone that evaluates her beliefs with wisdom.  I have not become a lazy Christian for lack of a challenge but instead learned to love others that are different from me and to articulate exactly what I believe.

With these skills i believe I will be ready and prepared for any employer's needs. \n     I also have experienced diversity and meeting new people that I probably would'nt have met outside of going to college.  It makes me appreciate different cultures and ways that are different from mine.  I believe college also helps you develop yourself as an individual.

My college experience, so far, has challenged me to think about topics and issues more in depth and taught me valuable skills that I know I will use for the rest of my life. Normally, I am a very quiet person and prefer to listen to, rather than engage in discussion;  college has been extreamely valuable for me because I can no longer let my parents do all of the talking. For me, college has been about improving my communication skills with others and learning to take responsibility for forming my own opinions and communicating them to others in a respectful and concise manner. In addition, I have discovered that I love Biology! The real-world application of biology can benefit so many people, so I hope to blend my passion for helping others with a degree in Biology into my plans for the future. \n\nCollege has been such an amazing experience; I am learning so much and I look forward to being able to help others with the knowledge and skills I am learning.",

I decided when I needed to study, what classes I attended, what activities I wanted to be involved and simply what type of person I wanted people to see.  I discovered what was important to me and what topics I was interested, which lead me to see what career field I was interested.  Not only did college help me to find myself and what my vocation was, I also look back and see how valuable the relationships were that I developed along the way.  I came out of college with genuine friends who will always be there for me.  I learned how to work as a team and cooperate with a group.

I have learned how to manage myself but also how to relax and enjoy the people around me.  While Hope is challenging academically, the extra effort I have had to give to my studies has taught me to be a devoted students and has improved my time managment skills. My college experience has been unique and different, personally crafted to fit my personality and needs. It has provided so many lessons, both in life and academics.

All of my classes have between 20 and 100 students. The professors get to know you at a personal level and help you succeed in academics and in a career. My professors know what their students are achieving even after they have graduated.  They are not just here to teach, but are here to engage with students on a personal level. There are no Teacher's Assistants teaching courses, allowing students to develop a relationship with their professors that can last a lifetime. Through a liberal arts education at Hope College, I learn skills outside of my engineering courses. I learn how to accept other cultures, to network and have developed better writing and communication skills. These various courses allow us to be well-rounded students. Learning about the world around us, instead of continuously looking at the outcome of grades is important. In the business world, we will have to interact with different types of people. Even with good grades, you still have to be open and understanding of other cultures. Hope College has helped me develop these necessary skills.",

I also would tell myself to let go of my inabition when it came to social situations and not to worry so much about what people might think. When I moved in I was so scared that people wouldn't like me that I  kind of barried myself in my studies instead of meeting new people. I have realized that the social aspect of college is almost as important as the acedemic aspect. As a senior I would definitely need to know that some will like me and some won't and it really doesn't matter if you have a thousand friends or just a couple. It's mostly just important to put ourself out there so people can get to know you and you can get to know them.",

Having one or two close friends to talk to always feels normal and takes you to memories of before.  Even if you're best friends are not at the same college or even in the same state, talking to them every now and then will definitely cheer things up. The first couple weeks of school are some of the most crucial to developing new friendships.  Everyone says 'Hello' as you walk by and seem friendly. After awhile the new excitement begins to fade and meeting new friends becomes more difficult as everyone has already found who they want to hang out with. So be sure to be friendly and meet lots of people as soon as you can to make as many friendships as possible. Just have a fun time and don't be scared to go up and talk.",

Find out for yourself what the school has to offer.  Take advantage of all the oppurtunities such as study abroad, clubs, organizations, community service, and do not be afraid to ask for help when needed.  The professors are there to help you and if you need extra help, go to the Academic Support Center, they are there for you and want nothing but to see you succeed.  If you do not know what you want to do for a carreer, that is OK, you are not alone and the Carreer Services will help you try to discover what you are meant to do.

When I walk down that sidewalk and I share a smile and simple greeting with a complete stranger I keep on smiling long after we pass because it makes me happy. If I were to go back in time I would tell myself to do nearly everything different in my college search. I would not only look for schools with good academic reputations, but really hone in on how the students interact with each other. I was lucky enough to end up at a college with such an atmosphere full of compassion. As human beings, we are social by nature. The most satisfying and rewarding things in life are genuine relationships with real people; friends, significant others, parents, professors. Money and jobs are material things that are secondary.

You have one job in college and that is to educate yourself.  What that means is that you can either choose to go to class, half-way listen, read the assignments, write the papers and focus on all the campus activitie, parties and new friends, or you can actively participate in the ultimate world of knowledge, intrigue, discovery and opportunity that college provides.  Nowhere else in your life are you going to be allowed to openly think and question and challenge like you will in college.  So do it.  Think.  Question.  Listen.  Challenge.  Resist the social distractions.  Embrace exploring new ideas.  Attend seminars, theatre productions, sponsored readings, art exhibits and rallies.  Dig deep and see how far you can push yourself.

The most important thing to realize is that you have time to make your decisions, and that you will end up where you are meant to be. It's commonly assumed that as a freshman in college you need to have a major picked at a college that is the perfect fit. The funny thing is that most of your peers will have no idea what career they desire, and if your chosen major or college doesnt feel right, you are allowed to make adjustments. Just relax and go where you feel the path seems brightest at the moment. You will end up exactly where you belong, no matter the choices and circumstances.\"",

I would give myself advice on which classes to take, and what professors to avoid. I think college and I got off on the wrong foot, and I wish I had been more easy going. You only go to college once so you have to make the most of it.

The first being: get sleep.  It is so tempting to stay up until 1 a.m. on weeknights, but then getting up at 7:30 a.m. the next morning for class is extremely difficult.  My Freshman year I found myself falling asleep during class in several lecture periods.  Though my performance on tests did not suffer terribly, it gave a poor impression of my commitment to the professor.\nThe second piece of advice that I would offer is get involved.  That is the best action that can be taken to create new friendships and a love for the college.  I was not very active in extra curriculars or clubs my first year, but I joined many groups in my Sophomore year.  By becoming involved, I created bonds to my school and to other students.  Peers would stop to chat or yell a friendly hello from across the courtyard as I walked to class.  A sense of pride and ownership in my school developed and I enjoyed representing my college.",

                "Joline ": "Take time to visit the colleges you're interested in, and visit more than once if you can.  It helps the decision making process a lot. Try visiting at different times of the year, and get an early start in the college search process if possible. Upon your arrival at college, get involved right away, talk to everyone you meet, and be open to new ideas. See what's out there and take some classes just for fun.",
                "Catherine ": "My advice to students entering college and to parents of students trying to make the most of the college experience is just to embrace it. There is so much worry and stress that goes into finding the right college and making big decisions that are involved with going to college that often people just get anxious but my philosophy is that things will work out- and our worries don't help anything. There are probably several colleges that a student can be happy at so the myth of \"the one and only perfect college for me\" just creates more stress, and if a student ends up at a college where they aren't happy they can learn what makes it not work for them and make changes- it isn't the end of the world. When you finally get to college dive in! There will be so many new things to try and people to meet-- explore it all! There are often programs for parents to get involved in as well and these are a great way for parents to keep up with what is happening at the college but still allowing their student freedom.",
                "Amy ": "Keep an open mind when you go on college visits because some of the schools you visit you would say \"I never want to go there\" but then in the end, thats where you feel like you belong. Look for a school that has a good program for your major. This is beacause since college comes with a high price tag, you definately need to make sure that you are getting your money's worth when it comes to an education. Also look at the professors and how well they know their area of teaching and backgrounds. See how avalible the professors are when it comes to help in a class or anything else because if they are unaccessible when you need them most, that will greatly cripple you. Look at how the students act on campus: Are they smiling? Do they say \"Hello\" to visitors on campus? How do they interact with the people around them? Try to find a school that has a social atmosphere that you know that you will definately fit into and will be able to form amazing friendship bonds because when you're at college: your peers become your family.",

On visitation days the serve better food, have more guides to help, and as many other things to make their school look better. There are the other days that you don't get to see if you only visit on visitation days and those days are needed to get the correct feel of the atmosphere of the school. It is also important to sit in on classes to see how the classes are structured there and if they fit your learning style.",
                "Daniel ": "I would tell them to prayerfully consider their options, visit the schools that are on the docket, see what feels right, and go with it. You want to be at a place where you will be happy. If you are miserable at college, there isn't much you can do other than drop out, and that is not something you want to do. Try to pick out the things in a school that are the most important to you, and don't settle for anything less. If your reasons are faith-based, academic-based, athletic-based, go for it! But remember, you are there to study first and foremost. If you are going to party, party, party, you may want to consider another option until the desire to learn arises. We have minds for a reason. College has the potential to be one of the best chapters in life. Search and search, and when you get any sort of an answer, go with it.",

Make sure that the college that you choose is the place that makes you feel at home.   When you are there you should feel as though you never left the comfort of your home.   The people there should be genuine and caring and will invite you in gladly.   When you find this school you will know it the moment you arrive there.",
                "Jill ": "Visit as many schools as possible so you can have great comparisons. If you think you could only thrive at a big school, try some small schools anyway, or if you want to venture out of state, still visit some close to home too. After visiting each school make a list of the pros and cons right away so you don't forget your likes and dislikes for each individual school.  Research each school through books, pamphlets and their websites to get a complete description, as well. After I had visited 7 schools, all completely different, I only applied to one because my visits had made my decision that clear. Good luck!",

Also, don't let finances be the largest factor. Your education is a great investment worth more than a given price. Determine what you want, narrow down the options, visit, and choose. You'll most likely be satisfied with where you go if you invest in the community and have a positive attitude. Don't settle.",
                "Branden ": "Choosing a college is obviously one of the biggest decisions of your student's life. It is also one that will shape the rest of his or her life. Preparing students for the real world is, of course, a matter of vocational training, but there is much more to the process than just that. Your student has views that will be strengthened or changed in college. New ideas will be abundant in this environment that is likely not completely under your control. As such, the choice of a college is also a choice about what kind of person this student will be. So rather than just choosing the college with the most stars or the best name recognition be sure to consider what kind of person goes to this school and comes out of this school. Campuses have lives and personalities of their own and you need to be sure that it is one that will make your student a better person as a result. There should be no single criterion that is used to determine what is a good college and each college should be evaluated as a whole. Enjoy discovering the world of colleges available.",
                "Amanda ": "Make sure that the student in picking the school that they like not one that the parents would like.",
                "I ": "For students: when looking for schools, consider what's important to you, then evaluate the schools you're thinking about based on all of your criteria, not just one or two of them.  Don't forget that the point of college is to get an education.  When you're at a school, take advantage of the opportunities available to you.   Don't focus on partying, but do have some fun.   Your professors and/or TAs (if your school is big enough to have grad students) will often want to help you - go their office hours, and don't be afraid to ask questions (if you don't know the answer, there's probably someone else who also doesn't).\n\nFor parents: Listen to your children.  Don't pressure them to go to the kind of school you wish you'd gone to.  Try to guide them away from making a truely wrong choice (in ANY way), but remember that at the end of the day it's their choice, and if you press them too hard, they're just as likely to refuse to even consider what you're saying as they are to heed your words.",

It is important to do so  during a weekday while classes are in session; this allows you to really get a feel for the campus community.

By this i mean to live in the dorms, get to know alot of different people, talk to people about their different backgrounds.

Don't feel like you have to go right into college after high school if you don't have a clear career path in mind,  you could save a lot of time and money if you wait....  if you are interested in travelling, look for a school that has a large study-abroad program and go for it! The \"real world\" doesn't often afford the opportunity so easily and affordably.  Work hard on finding a group of friends during your first year, but don't be afraid to break away from your high school group.  Take the chance to start fresh in a new environment and be who you want to be.  Do the things you want to do, prove to yourself that you can be independent.  Living away from home makes you appreciate it all the more when you come home for breaks; three hours' drive was the perfect distance for me: not too close and not too far.  The \"college experience\" is fun, but don't forget that you are there to study... appreciate the opportunity you have to determine your future!",

They have even been moved from course to course to find what they would fit in best just so they don't have to leave, but they really shouldn't be teaching. One of the college professors I knew didn't even know most of the class materials she was teaching so she had to sit in in an identical class taught by a phenominal professor in the time period right before she taught.

When I first started college I wanted to be a teacher but I let the fear of societys outlook on there not being a lot of teaching jobs, cause me to go into nursing. After two years of studying nursing and working at a hosiptal I realized I enjoyed learning about health care but it was not something I was passionate about. I also worked with other people that were not passionate about health care yet they would just go through the motions. That is when I realized I did not want a job where I was just going through the motions. I wanted to do something I was passionate about! That is when I decided to not let the fear society put in my head about teaching get in the way of me studying my passion, and now I have my bachelors in liberal studies and am currently working on my masters in special education and loving it!",

It took me a couple years into community college to really grasp the idea that I was in control. Once I got it into my head that I alone can decide my future that is when my future started presenting opportunities to me. I would tell myself to not take English your first semester and to not take those silly classes that have nothing to do with your major or general education plan. Don't waste your time! That would be the main thing I would tell myself. I would also tell myself to apply for financial aid, I never once before now applied for any aid and I deeply regret it. I can't say I've made many mistakes because I'm on the right track now. My past self would probably love being pushed a little bit more though.

There is no reason to sweat the small stuff or even what may seem like the large obstacles in life because they are meant to be. It is important to work hard in school each and every single day because as much as it is hard to admit, and even realize it really does matter. Another piece of advice I would give myself would without a doubt be to not believe in back up plans. It is important to go after your goals because if you don't then the rest of your life will be lived wondering, \"what if?\". It may be hard, and it may at times seem impossible but the day that you achieve those goals you will not at all be concerned with the small struggles.",

There is a danger in wasting time and accruig a very large school debt, not to mention other peoples investments (grants & scholarships).  It is necessary to take some time;  travel, interview people in their careers, take a personality test,  learn in interships.

I would also tell myself not to let the little things come between your friends and yourself. Those things just build up and soon it is too late to fix them. You also cant worry about what people think about you; you will ruin your last year of high school if your always worried about being \"perfect.\" Just have fun and enjoy the people your with while you can because more likely than not, you will lose touch and not see them again until your high school reunions.",

Part of achieving success is not just finishing school with the most honors but having fun along the journey.  Its also good to keep in mind that you will fail over and over again but thats okay, eventually you will figure it out and become a pro.

Nothing has ever been more frightening for me than the thought of leaving the home, city, school, and people I knew and loved to begin all over again somewhere else. Indeed, some of the most depressing and sorrow-filled days (weeks, months) of my life were my freshman year of college. Having survived and flourished out of that year, I know what I would say to my high school senior self: \"It's okay.\" Not, \"Don't be scared,\" or \"It won't be that bad,\" or even \"You'll get through it\" because those sentiments would have been too grand, too cliche, and too illogical for me to have accepted. I have no doubt that who I am today is due in part to having made it through that year. My college experience  has not been tainted by freshman year; rather it has been enriched.  \"It's okay\" was what I needed to hear most during that year and as a highschooler it was the basic reassurance I needed to feel confident to face the challenges ahead.",

It is important for the student to see what type of atmosphere they will be learning in and what types of students and faculty members they will be interacting with on a daily basis. In order to get the best experience at a college, the best thing that a student can do is live on campus and get involved with extra-curricular activities as often as possible. Students should try to make close, long-lasting friendships with their fellow students because college will impact their lives forever. In order to get the best education, students need to make sure that they get their homework done ahead of time and avoid procrastination. It is also very important that the student be willing to approach his/her professors with any questions or concerns about their classes and/or homework.

If you pick a college that you really enjoy going to and getting involved with, your experience will be so much more fullfilling and you will undoubtedly learn lessons that can't always be taught in th classroom.   Also, look at the relationships between the professors and the students.

The drive should not be so far away from your living situation that you will not want to make the commute, and start missing classes. lastly, one should look for a college that has a social or sports life that fits your lifestyle."

My senior year of high school was the least favorite of mine throughout highschool, mainly because I was focused on AP and honor classes and didn't enjoy being a senior. I'd advise myself to not make serious decisions, especially on career and major options, because it might change later on. I'd also advise myself to be involved in extracurricular activities and build relationships that will last beyond highschool. By doing this, I will have no regrets when I get to the college level and not wonder \"what if?\"  All in all, I'd tell my high school senior self to savor the moment and have fun because you only get to be in high school once.",

While being independent can be a good thing, sometimes you need someone else to lend a hand.",
                "Carly ": "I would encourage all seniors to consider applying and going to a community college to earn all of their core credits (English, Math, Science, etc..) before going on to a 4 year college.  This step allows you to figure out what you are interested in without paying those huge university tuition bills and if you have to work while in school, community colleges almost always offer night and weekend classes and you can take classes during the summer as well.  Almost all credits earned at a community college are transferrable to four year colleges and some community colleges even have an agreement with some four year colleges that once a student has completed a certain number of credit hours at the community college level, they are guaranteed acceptance into the four year program of their choice.  For those students looking to get into a job sooner, community college is usually the best place to go to get the degree you want in order to get an entry level job and there are many online colleges that can help you earn a higher degree once you have gotten your Associate's Degree from community college.",

I really enjoy school and all it has to offer, and have the time to actually reap the benefits. So if I could go back in time and talk to myself, I would kick myself right in the seat of my pants and scream WAKE UP.

I earned my associate degree in arts and science, which means I took most of my general education classes my junior and senior year of high school. What I especially love about tech is the small class sizes. I never felt like my professor did not know my name. Every class my professors would address me by name. Secondly, I loved the cafe on campus. I love to eat, so I was always in the cafe. Latoya and Mike some of the cafe staffers knew who I was and always let me in on upcoming deals on cafe items and changes to the menu. Lastly, everyone knows everyone at tech. The people in classes will remember who you are after the class in over. The people beside you will more than likely become your friends depending on the class. The more interaction you have with the class and the teacher the better experience you will have at tech.  I personally love tech, the professors I had and the friends that I've made. I have done all I can do at tech and it is sad that I will be leaving to peruse my education at a 4 yr college but I will never forget where my college level education started."

They saw it as just a technical college and did not respect it and to some degree neither did I before I started to attend it. The teachers are so passionate and cultured. One of my favorites professors Babatunde is from Nigeria is an extremely interesting and understanding teacher. He taught me more math in a semester then I learned in almost all of high school.  Because of the cost of attending HGTC and the transfer program, it offers we have a very diverse school. Ive met people from Algeria, Morroco, Israel, Ethiopia. Nigeria and many more places.

In college, the student has more responsibility and it is not required for them to show up: the student doesn't show up to class, they get dropped.

For example, the professors do not always make it clear to what their office hours are if a student would like to speak with them out of class. Also, some of the staff in the offices seem like they do not know what they are doing at times. Therefore, a student will have further questions that the staff can't even answer sometimes. However, they do have computer labs if atudents need to work on their papers and projects. There isnt any on campus housing because it is a community college so that isn't an issue. The food on campus is okay but not that great. They do have a workout room however, it is very small and it is rarely open. "

We had a dairy, radio station, hog farm, construction team, etc. We learned a positive work ethic and our grades reflected our dedication to excellence."

An Associate's degree can help you get your foot in the door of a job you've always been interested in, while also allowing you to develop and take on new challenges. You will encounter numerous kids that desire to explore different occupations and disciplines because the thinking of students as a whole is rather similar. Overall, think of Houston Community College as a head-start if you're interested in searching for a future career objective but lack the time or resources to devote to a 4-year university!"

Being a community college, it doesn't have much of the student life aspect of things, but there are some events and groups if you know where to look. The teachers online are often easier to communicate with then those that teach in-person classes, but the education is good. "

My initial impression of my campus was that it is clean, beautifully renovated and any tools necessary to complete my school work is readily available to me. I find that I study best on campus because the environment is bright, friendly, yet private, as well. As for my advisors, professors and campus faculty, I have found some very nice people I know I can turn to with any concerns and or questions. \n\nI enjoy going to campus, because I know I will return home having learned something new and different. While I do recall a lot of great things that I have encountered at school, I have also ran into a few professors that are hard to follow, or even unbearably hard to cooperate with. I have even come across an advisor or two that are in the least bit helpful, but I really do believe the positives outweigh the negatives!"

The downside is that some of the students are part time and therefore this inhibits a lot of interactions on campus(if you are shy it is very hard to interact). However the staff there is incredibly skilled and intelligent. All professors I have had treat their students professionally and office hours are for the most part always respected. Overall for my needs Houston Community College (HCC) fit me and so far has helped get the resources together in order for me to succeed in transferring to a four year university. Overall I would recommend HCC for Houston natives as it is a cheap and reliable education, I have a lot of friends who are international students who find HCC very well fit for their needs and open to their culture.

The academic advisers aren't as helpful as I would have liked but at the end of the day I graduated with an associates in science and was able to start my pre-COMD program right away! The professors I had there were excellent, and I particularly enjoyed my Creative Writing professors. I also took a few online courses and they were all smooth and painless and my professors were always quick with replying to emails about classwork. The three campuses I attended class at (Spring Branch, Katy, and Cinco Ranch) were nicely kept and had excellent computer labs and libraries. If you're not quite ready for the \"big leagues\" of higher education, HCC is a great stepping stone to get back into the grind of schoolwork. Or if you're simply looking to get a two-year degree, this college is definitely a great one. Nearly all of my credits were transferable, minus classes like remedial math, and the financial aid advisers were incredibly helpful throughout my two years there. Definitely a community college worth considering."

The best thing is the layout of each campus.  It is very easy to get around and find your way.  I think the campus size(s) is(are) just right.  There are bookstores and vending on each campus so you can pick up a snack if you need to but there are no eateries that I know of.\r\n\r\nMost of my time on campus is spent in the Communications Department, either in classes or in labs.  It seems that there is always a lab open.  The department works really hard to make sure we students have access as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen I tell people that I am enrolled at HCC I receive nothing but excitement and encouragement.  I really believe HCC has a good local reputation.\r\n\r\nTo call Houston a college town would be funny to me as we are so huge.  There is nothing one can't find in this city.  Luckily I'm a local gal and know this town like the back of my hand (almost).\r\n\r\nThe professors are great.  Very approachable.  Very open.  The Financial Aid Department, well let's just say it's not anyone's favorite department.  I am learning my way around more and more with each passing semester.  It's safe to say it helps to utilize fellow students experiences and wisdom.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of a lot of school pride.  I am aware of a lot of self-pride in many of the students.  I think this speaks to the ability of the professors to reach the students on a wide level.\r\n\r\nThe one experience I'll always remember?  Definitely my very first class at Willie Gay.  It was a mandatory \"get acquainted with college\" course.  I was so nervous.  And when I first when in I thought I had nothing in common  with any of these kids and then something magic happened.  The professor began teaching and he was great.  He brought all of together through a common ground....learning.

If what I choose to do does not challenge my curiosity then it is not worthwhile. After having come a long way, through several not so good choices, at the age of 26, I finally realized that I really love the selfless work that nurses do and I can't wait to be a part of it. I also regret caring so much about unimportant things and especially about what others thought.

Make your choices carefully; visualize their effects on your future. Never depart from your academic paths unless it is a genuine change made with no other outside influences. Every grade counts!

I would suggest that a student should complete all of the \"core\" classes and possibly complete an Associate Degree program prior to moving on to a large four years college for a Bachelors degree. \nThere are many reasons for this advice. First of all college life is expensive. Even when living in a dorm you have boarding expenses, additional computer/communication expenses like internet access and telephone lines. Secondly, it is very difficult to have a good paying job and stay focused on success in the classroom concurrently. Third is the fact that change is stressful and going  away to college is stressful. I would suggest staying at home if possible and get accustomed to college life without the trials and tribulations of being in a new city with strangers and new distractions. I have been told at Freshman orientations that as many as 61% of Freshman do not make it to the Sophomore year. I believe it is for the reasons mentioned.",

There were nights at home that I would just be glued to my computer screen and get nothing done or actually studying, but falling asleep with the textbook. Also there were those countless hours of lack of sleep.  Although I took AP classes, I only did that so that I can get the AP credit, but I pass none of those exams.  I had the opportunity to, but I let it slip by having fun at school and being lazy.  It?s a disappointment to see myself retake all these classes again, wasting money that I could have saved for my education and possibly even get eight hours of sleep some nights.

It gave me a drive to further my education and pursue my dreams to becoming an Architect. I know the road ahead is challenging but with my faith I know anything is possible. Thinking back when I was in high school, I thought college would be nothing but a big party. This transition showed me everything what my parents and counselors were trying to tell me.

Also i would tell myself to get more involved in clubs and orginizations. Because one it would look good on my college applications and two it would help me learn how to handle my stress that much better. Learning how to handle stress would helped me out so much and saved me multiple headaches. I would tell myself to learn how to take good notes early on and how to study for tests without a review or any other study help instead of just my notes and the book. My high school hindered us way too much in the way we took tests. We always got the review which it would be the same as the test just mixed up.

It can get a little confusing when getting information actually to the students. Good class size and professors. People wish there was better food and activities on campus."

                "Comment": "Overall, I think that Howard Community College is a fantastic place in terms of education and staff. The degree programs are easy to follow, and provide a solid foundation to later transfer your credits. In addition, there are a variety of colleges and universities that have guaranteed admission agreements with HCC, which can act as an incentive to keep your grades up. Aside from pursuing a degree to transfer, HCC is helpful to those seeking a second degree or a new career paths; again, their degree programs are easy to follow and keep up with. The majority of professors are enthusiastic about their subject, which makes classes interesting to attend and learn in, and are easily contactable outside of class. The one drawback of this school is the lack of social atmosphere - there's no sense of greater community. However, the excellent standards of education more than make up for it, and HCC in general is a great option for those seeking a college where they can build a foundation, or go straight into a career from.

I was unsure what I wanted to do after college, and so I thought going to community college was a good decision. It turned out to be a fantastic decision that I believe everyone should consider. It made me realize what I wanted to do in life and what career path I wanted to enter. The staff at HCC is incredible, and I almost always had a positive experience with them. I highly recommend HCC for students who live in the area and for those who are looking to go to college, but are not yet sure what their overall plans are. Even if you do know what you would like to do after school, I believe that HCC is a good start because the campus is wonderful, staff is amazing, and you can save some money."

I was unsure of what I wanted to major in and I was envious of my other friends who were already enjoying \"campus/dorm life\" at their respective universities. After a year of attending HCC, my perception completely changed. The subjects I struggled with most in high school, became my strongest courses. I know that without the constant help and availability my professors provided, I would not be able to be a 4.0 nutritional science student. I recommend HCC to anyone who wants the best for his or her own education."

I have been given an opportunity to further my education that many before me were not able to have!  I have had several teachers that have been instrumental in making my experience so much richer.  Mrs. Nancy Treadwell has been an amazing influence on my life.  She has been a wonderful teacher.  She is tough, but she is fair!  Her English class was really challenging.  I feel that it prepared me for graduate-level classes.  She was encouraging, and she really took an interest in who I was.  She is one of the few educators who has been firm in her beliefs and firm in her expectations.  I have also had a lot of help in the administration office.  They have bent over backwards to accommodate my needs and to help me succeed."

This is community college so honestly, it's pretty underwhelming, and the number one thing I'd change is the smoking ban, I am a smoker, and many many of the students here smoke, and the smoking ban is an inconvenient pain.  I do not like telling people I go to HCC but it could be worse, HCC is an academically sound school. I have yet to interact with any school administrators. And as far as controversies we're a pretty apathetic school when it comes to scandals, whatever else that makes university life interesting. HCC is dull and the food is not great, also the hours of the cafe are strange. The hours of the school in general are strange. Other than that the school is alright, the work load is about average. "

When I was a senior I had my heart set on going to my dream school and I was not open to any other possibilities; while I still want to end up at my dream school eventually, I now realize how important stepping back and considering my options objectively is. While going to my dream school would have provided me with more opportunities for internships and allowed me to have a \"college experience\", my current school allows me to attend without incurring large amounts of debt and has an excellent academic program. This thinking would have helped me make other good decisions in my senior year from academics, to friendship, to my health.  I was in a huge hurry to grow up and get on with my adult life as a senior, and I should have taken some time to think about my decisions.",
                "Jon": "When you transfer into college make sure that you have your degree program mapped out.  What I mean by this, is that you should have a schedule of how many credits, and what specific classes you are going to take each semester so that you keep a good balance of credits each semester.  I personally did not do the best job of this and now I am taking over 18 credits so that I can graduate on time.  Having a mapped out plan creates peace of mind as a student because you have exact direction throughout your collge life.  Also, interacting with teachers and going to office hours whenever you can creates good communication which can help you out towards the end of the semester as they are more willing to help students who show interest and dedication in their course.",

Go to class, do your work, and don't let their teaching style dictate what you achieve in that course. And find a tutor for goodness sake. The learning assistance center is there for a reason.  \nFriends--don't worry about finding them, but do sign up for classes and activities you truly enjoy. It's in those places you will find people you connect with. \nFolders, folders, folders! Go to a summer school supply sale and buy at least twenty of them--and get colorful!

From books to labs fees, to general tuition, the cost of education is rising yearly.  With that said, it is wise to apply for money to pay for an education by filling out applications.  Although, my mother constantly bugged me about filling out scholarships, I routinely ignored her stating, ?I was on vacation?.   Knowing what I know now, I would have advised myself to apply for at least two scholarship applications a week.  I attended a workshop during the summer which informed me how to apply for scholarships.  Through this workshop a meet a lady who financed her entire education with private scholarships.

College life provides many new experiences that will enrich my life.  It is important, however, to make sure that those experiences do not deter me from accomplishing my objective: a degree.  The best way to do this is to write down my goals, map out the steps that will be the plan to accomplish those goals, and re-evaluate my progress daily.  I should align myself with three types of people: ones who have already accomplished what I am seeking to do; peers with similar goals as mine; and people whom I can help attain what I have already accomplished.  The first group will serve as guides, mentoring me along my path.  They can help me if I get off course.  The second group serves as support, challenging me as we move forward together.  The last group will serve as motivation, encouraging me to lead by example.  It is important for students to focus on their goals.  If I follow this advice, I will be sure to succeed in college.",

I'm not going to lie, it is not as easy as high school but there are way too many helpful resources around campus to help with any issue that you may have. College is fun. You get to make your own schedule and choose the time of day you want to go to class. If you are a late sleeper, go to class in the afternoon or evening. If you are a morning person, take the early classes. Just make sure you register for your classes as early as possible to get the classes and times that you really want.

I have also struggled to make a living without a college degree, and continue to struggle to support my family as I work towards achieving one.\nIf I were to talk to myself as a high school senior, I would tell myself to go to college right away. There have been many dreams I have had to put aside since then in the interest of survival. I may well appreciate my education better as an older student, but the struggles to get here could have been avoided.  \nI would also advise myself to become immersed in the social aspects of college. I never got the chance to join a sorority or paticipate in campus activities, for by the time I got to school, I had a family to support.

Having a job just to make money won't make you happy in the long run. College is the perfect (and maybe the only) opportunity to learn about something you are actually interested in so that when you graduate, you can work in a field that interests you. Knowing now that after graduation I can work in the field of alternative energy and have a positive impact on my environement I wish I had accepted college sooner.

The most important advice is to focus on time management and being organized. In college you're on your own and have to take control of your own life. If you don't manage your time, you'll be cramming big time during midterm and finals weeks. NOT fun!!!  Also make sure you pick the school that is right for you. Tour many schools before you decide where to attend. If possible arrange a day or two to shadow someone and get a true feeling for the campus.

Even though I got excepted to their honors program, I thought that the classes would not be too challenging or that there would not be a lot to do around campus. I would tell myself that I was wrong. There is plenty to do and it is a great place to meet people who are in the same situation as yourself. The classes are actually very challenging but the teachers help you a lot more than they would have in a 4-year school with lectures of students in the hundreds. I learned that the transition is easier to a community college as I have seen many people who went off to 4-year schools right away and have found themselves in sticky situations not knowing how to handle partying and studying. I would tell myself I made a good choice in taking a small step first before the big one next year.",

Yes, school is about working hard and doing the best job you can do.  However, getting a college education is ultimately for your benefit.  It is not worth it to spend all of your time stressing out about applying for college.  Enjoy the transition.  Use your time as a senior to take some time to reflect on how much you've accomplished and how much you will accomplish in your college education.  After all, school is more about being faithful to do well than to be a perfectionist.",

Make sure i study for evey test or quiz.  It's much more work then you have to do then in high school.  It's more on your own when it comes to some of the classwork that you are doing.  I would tell myself to not give up on work saying, \" I can't do this\", but telling myself i can do this work to boast my confidence to being successful in school.  One of the most important thing to tell myself is to always do homework and essay's when you get them because sometimes when you don't have enough time to do them, the harder it is to try and complete them in the smaller time before it is due."

I was told before I came that I could use the Hazelwood act and then told I couldn't, then I had a financial advisor try to tell me I could use it, but she was wrong. I love majority of my professors, but I am transferring because the school is too expensive and as a teaching major it is not worth going into a bunch of debt."

However, attempts to handle this uncertainty myself only increased my stress, so, finally, I started praying, \"God, where do YOU want me to be?\" Two months before graduation, God put HPU in my path. During my tour, I realized that I did not want to be a \"number\" on a campus or find my identity in any accomplishment. I saw the academic advantages of a smaller college, the plethora of opportunities at this University, and, most importantly, the tools I needed to grasp my identity in Christ and grow personally. The process of making my college decision was a real-life testament to Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV), \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\" I am currently a freshman cheerleader studying jurisprudence in the Honors Academy here at Howard Payne University. Thankfully, I have not once experienced the common freshman feeling of being \"lost in the shuffle.\" No matter where I go on campus, I always see a friendly face. I am proud to be completing my undergraduate studies as a Yellow Jacket. Sting 'Em!\n"

I would say that some students are more competitive than others, but the majority of us just try to do our best and do well in our classes. \r\n\r\nA lot of Howard Payne graduates go into really good jobs or go on to get a higher degree. The professors really try to steer you in a professional direction by giving you hands on, applicable lessons that are actually going to help you in life. \r\n\r\nOne of my favorite classes that I've taken here was a Forensic Science class. We learned how to do all of these really cool forensic tests like fingerprint analysis and blood splatter analysis. Our final for that class was a mock crime scene where we had to find clues and develop a good hypothesis of what we believed happened. Our professor dressed up as a judge and we had to go in individually and ask for him to sign a warrant!! It was the best final ever! ",

Also Brownwood is a pretty lame town, you pretty much have to entertain yourself cause there's not much to do in town. \r\n\r\nThe people at Howard Payne are also so great; I have always felt very welcomed and important here. The professors are amazing too, they invest so much in us as students and truly want to see us succeed. Plus they're just fun! Most of my favorite people ever are at this school which I think is really saying something.\r\n\r\nHang out spots change a lot because, like I said, there's not much to do in town so you're constantly having to come up with things to do and places to hang out. Some of my favorite memories have come about from being bored and having to think of something to entertain ourselves with. Hanging out in friends' dorms or apartments is always a good option though and something I do often.\r\n",

If you want to meet amazing people, make lasting friendships, and have experiences that you will NEVER forget, this is the place for you! The professors are wonderful and helpful, the staff is encouraging, and there is ALWAYS something going on. Campus events are frequent and so worth the effort of joining in. People often think that HPU isn't fun because of the small town, but that makes it better in my opinion. We make our own fun around town, and for cheap also. And what college student doesn't like cheap? Also, the community is awesome and there are TONS of ways to get plugged in on and off campus. "

My favorite times at HPU is as a Resident Assistant.  I was able to invest in new students and help them have the same wonderful experience that I had .  My Resident Director, who was more like a mentor, is who I think about when I think about Howard Payne University (my alma mater).  She, like many people, have invested in me and my future simply because that is their heart's desire.",

In the few months I've been here, I've already discovered some not-so-wonderful things about myself, but it's important for me to know who I am, inside and out, so I can work towards a better future. Howard Payne in particular has been a wonderful place for me to go, because I'm still free to do, basically whatever i want, but there's enough guidance and structure available if i need it, so that I won't get lost in the crowd or allow things to get out of control. The faculty and staff here are some of the most caring people I've ever met, and the students exemplify the same qualities and characteristics.",

EVERYDAY LIFE IS A LEARNING GAME. BEING IN SCHOOL TEACHES YOU A TRADE THAT YOU HAVE A LOVE FOR SO YOU CAN TAKE THAT SKILL AND HELP PEOPLE. I LEARNED THAT I AM A BETTER STUDENT THAN I WAS GIVING MY SELF CREDIT FOR. JUST ENJOYING THE LITTLE STEPS THAT ARE THOUGHT TO US TO HELP MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER.

My first college I went to I got rear-ended by a drunk driver and was also sexual harassed, and the officals at the school did nothing about either of those incidences.  When I first began going to school at Howard Payne I was afraid it was going to turn out just like that, but I was wrong.  The teachers are wonderful, the students are amazing, the administrators are helpful, and the whole campus is laid back.  It's been a wonderful experience and I've even made friends.  Which is valuable to me because with my past I'm not one to be outgoing, but at the college people take you under their wings and I'm very grateful for that.",

Everyone else is just as lost as you are.  Take a chance and do things outside your comfort zone.  Freshman orientation is loads of fun.  Go for it.",
                "Danielle ": "First of all, it starts with your high school career. Get your grades in place then start looking at a variety of colleges early. The earlier you start looking and applying for different colleges the better chance you will have at getting the one you want. Choose different colleges with different sizes visit them and get a feel for what you may or may not like. Parents, don?t decide for you kids what school they want; it?s their future so simply give them the pros and cons of your opinions. Students, choose something you can live with for the next four or more years.  You are going to be spending the majority of your time there, so make sure it?s a place you are not going to hate in three weeks. Next start looking at the cost and then the scholarships they offer. Make sure you get something you can afford and won't be paying off the rest of your life. After finding the right one, get settled in and make the most of the beginning of the rest of your life.

To make the most out of college is to jump into everything possible. It will open the door for endless friendships. Making the right friends will make or break your college experience.

Yes, you have chosen to go to college to earn your degree, but you also are there to live and begin your adult life. Also look into the town. How big is the town and what is there to do? Will the town just get you in trouble or will it help you further with your education?",
                "Vanessa ": "Parents: allow your children to pick where he or she wants to go. Dont force a school on your child, bu simply suggest visiting schools to find where he or she will fit in most. Money should be an issue in helping your student find a school. Now-a-days, they have great scholarships and loans that can fit your lifestyle best.  Students: its not impossible for you to find a college that suits you. Going to a college where you fit in is the best choice you could make.  Allow yourself to be vulnerable and make new friends. Dont worry about it being to expensive, ther are many opportunities to pay for school, just ask. GOOD LUCK!",

Work hard and leave the partying to those who don't care. Always respect your professors and they will help you. But most of all, you must abide by these three words: \"and then some\". Do what is required of you and then some. You can't go wrong as long as you put forth your best and don't hold back.",

                "Tabitha ": "Don't be afraid to be who you are. Colleges are made up of many different people coming from many backgrounds, and each person is trying to discover who they are and what they truly believe during their collegiate experience. During this time, it is easy to conform to what is going on around you, but be sure to stand for what makes you different and focus on what you can do with that discovery. As far as finding the right place, be sure to visit at many campuses as possible, and ask questions about each one. Go where you can see yourself fulfilling these ideas the best. Then do what you can do make a difference on your campus; who knows the impact you can have by being yourself!",
                "Derek ": "I would recommend that  students be real with themselves and what they want to do. If they enjoy being in an atmosphere that more closly resembles a crowded party scene, then a smaller more private university is not a good fit for them. If they want to be able to pick from a rather large variety of majors and class options, then they need to look for a school that offers such. And parents, putting added pressures on a student to figure out right now what they want from life and who they will be in ten years is a bad idea. These next few years are a time when people really begin to uncover who they are and what they stand for. There is no way of knowing who a person will turn out as when you ask them right before they undergo such a process and time.",
                "Justin ": "There are several things that I would tell anyone who is about to embark on the endeavor of choosing a college and a major. My advice would simply be to follow what your heart tells you. This may sound cheesy and unrealistic but, in reality, it's not. If you want to attend a large university, go for it! If you want to major in something that you've always dreamed of doing, do it! Never listen to doubt. Do not deter from your dream because or hard circumstances. It is your dream, your future, and your life. Put your faith in what you most believe in and let God handle the rest. This is the chance of a lifetime, and it is your chance.",

I would definitley encourage them to spend time visiting different kinds of colleges to find what really is going to give them the best experience while helping them meet their educational goals. Once they find the college that fits them, I'd tell them to dig in. Again, getting the best experience really depends on how much the student puts into it. By digging in and getting involved and seeing what's out there, students are going to find the place that they love to fit the most and that's going to make their college experience so much more memorable. The academics will fall into place if they've chosen the place that they believed was the best fit. It's the balance between the academic and social that makes for a great college experience. Not only will this give them great memories, but it will prepare them for the future beyond college. It will give them their footing for the rest of their life.",
                "Denise ": "Although some may focus on environment and chances to have fun, the most important thing is your education. Which school has an academic plan to suit your own needs? Go to one that has the major you need, and tools to help you grow. Before going to this school, I never had the opportunity to participate in music with such dedication.  My other university didn't have a cohesion between the theater and music departments, and very few ensembles. Go where you can recieve the best knowledge and experience. However, also take into account location. There is not a day that goes by that I don't miss the big city. Choose and environment thats familiar, or at least has access to what you know.  When you are surrounded by the familiar, college seems like less of a transition, and more of a continuation to your education. Also, check out the school's policy on AP credits. If they accept anything lower than a 3, run far in the other direction. Low standards do not prepare you for success.  If you plan on graduate work, pick a school that is know for students continuing. Always increase your chance for success.",
                "Kara ": "Find a college that you can afford and a college in a area where there are things to do off campus. Make the best of your experience and try to not focus on how far away from home it is. Enjoy the process!",

I am not saying that you need to experiment and do crazy stuff.  Stay legal.  You can find out way more stuff sober.  But really be involved in university life.  When you are looking at schools, look at the school spirit and look at all the opportunities they give for you to do stuff on campus.  Being involved is the greatest way to make life long connections with fellow students."

I was weak and didn't know how to speak up for myself and justify my God Given brilliance.  I believe my friend knew this about me and other African-American youth, who grew up isolated in PWIs.  The best way for me to put my experience in words is to say, for the first time in my life, I was able to experience \"black priviledge\".  Why?  I was no longer the only smart African-American in the room.  Truthfully speaking, I was less intelligent than most of the African-Americans, Africans and other international students who I sat beside in class. Howard is an unspoken gem, as are most of your HBCUs and that is why your HBCUs produce 80% of today's corporate professionals.  The African students throw off the curve in most of your math and science classes because they are educated under a much more rigorous educational system.  Thus, you have to work extremely hard to do well and I did.  Since I left Howard, my life has been nothing but wonderful.  I'm so proud to be a Bison and with all the lies and seed of racial injustice being sewn in our world, our students need to run to the HBCU, for they will be free there, to do the only thing they need to do at this time.  \"Learn and grow\".  For all of you who want to know the terrain, the area around HOWARD UNIVERSITY has been gentrified.  It is VERY safe and fun, lots of cool and eclectic people all around.  So should go and Enjoy!"

I'd suggest coming prepared to spend a lot of time alone, because it can be hard to form connections, especially if you're an introvert or you don't like going to events a ton. It can be suffocating being in the city surrounded by people all the time. It's really helpful to find activities that you enjoy that you can turn to to refresh, since the social life and academics can be immensely draining."

                "Comment": "I have a \"love/hate\" relationship with Howard University. There is definitely some people  who are super involved and love everything about Howard and for the rest of us, we're just trying to graduate. Howard administration makes it hard for students to continue because  they often don't have answers to the questions we have. If you are provided with answers, it may or may not be accurate. Howard has been known to have some money issues but they are trying to keep the school in it's best condition. There is construction on one of the upperclassmen dorms and the cafeteria. However, the construction is causing a strain on the students because there isn't enough on campus housing for everyone. With the new construction on the cafeteria, that means there will only be one main cafeteria for the whole student body. Food at Howard is subpar but there are good days. I've had my fair share of poor teachers but I have met some really dedicated teachers. The dedicated teachers really outweigh the bad.  You can usually find the more dedicated teachers in your major classes. The majority of the Howard student body is active in at least one club and organization. There is always new clubs popping up and it is popular to create a club if there isn't one you are looking for. The school does have visitation policies but they are becoming more modern with it. This past year we updated the policy to be 24-hours with a student ID.  "

My experience at Howard taught me so much about resilience and tenacity, as I fought every year to remain financially cleared. Being surrounded by socially/culturally-aware students, who prided themselves in scholarship, pushed me to allow my merit to reflect my work ethic.  It is because of my time spent at Howard University that I am now an advocate for global education, having traveled and interned at some of America's leading companies. Moreover, since attending HU, I have nurtured my love for community outreach and volunteering. While the journey was nowhere near easy, I do not believe I would have benefitted as much as I have at any other university. "

If you're from Howard, you automatically make that connection with another HU student or alum. The bond between Bison is as strong as super glue. There are also more than 20 groups and organizations on campus where many people can find a place to belong or do something they enjoy. \n\nThe negative aspects of the school are the academics, dining, administration/staff, \"late\" culture, and lack of diverse thought.  Most of the teachers do not teach well, forcing you to learn the material yourself and hoping that you get those test questions right. The cafeteria is horrible. I am a vegan and there is a greater variety than at the beginning of the year, however the selection is still very narrow. Even non-vegans on campus complain how horrible the food is (not to mention  the ridiculously expensive meal plan prices). Getting anything done with financial aid and registration is difficult because either the staff doesn't know what they are doing or they take a very long time to get the task finished. There's also a campus-wide habit of being late to events, so I always have to deal with the awkwardness of arriving on time only for everyone else to show up 10 minutes later. Finally, it seems like there is no diverse opinion here. Everyone hates white people (although they would never admit to it) and they only see there problems caused by \"institutional racism\" or being a woman. \n\nOverall, despite the fact that there are more negatives than positive, I only rated HU three stars because this experience is what I make of it. I am telling myself that this school needs me for improvement. I need to be the change that I want to see. "

Coming here you will find yourself and discover so much about yourself, especially if you are black/ African american in some way. The cultural aspect of the school is definitely what stands out. Being from a foreign country and having a different cultural background is cherished and put on a high pedestal here. You will see people from places you have never heard of, speaking languages you did not even know existed. The people here are so friendly, you meet and speak to different people everyday whether you are an introvert or an extrovert and people are very quick to help here. The main issue with Howard is the administration. Going to the financial aid office is a nightmare, you are guaranteed to have to stay in line for at least and hour and even after you do speak with someone your issue will probably not be solved. You will learn how to be very independent here and learn how to do things for yourself like actively go out and looks for jobs or internships because you will not get much help from the school at all. Overall the atmosphere is my favorite part of Howard, will I stay here for all four years? We will see."

So apparently this area isn't use to that, so it took a whole week for them to clean up the four feet of snow. Classes were canceled, people were stranded, it was a complete mess.

Many students wake up early on Saturday morning to do the regular community service, they may go to brunch with a few friends after, get some studying in, the turn it up at night either at the club or at one of the six house parties going on. Other students do movie nights, kick backs, shopping, or just escaping to NY for the weekend on the Chinabus to chill.

Most Freshman males stay in Drew Hall, which is not very physically attractive, but a great freshman experience.  The does not have air conditioning, and just like many of Howards buildings it is not in the best condition.  The freshman girls typically stay in \u201cThe Quad\u201d which has four different sections, some sections more favorable than others.  Some of the rooms are very clean and spatial, while others hold three girls in one room that seems to be only fit for one person.  Cook Hall and the East Towers are the best dorms Howard University has to offer.  Cook Hall is in the best location, the only dorm that is legitimately located on campus (I stayed there freshman year, and literally woke up each morning about 15 minutes before class and still able to make it on time.), this dorm has pretty big rooms and each room has its own bathroom to share with one person.  The East Towers are not in the best condition but are great because they are in suite style, (two or three rooms with a full kitchen and bathroom) and the dorm has 24 hour visitation (yes other dorms at Howard have visitation rules), but the East Towers are reserved for students in the honors program.  West Towers are just like the East only they may not have 24hour visitation, depending on if the residents follow the rules.  Howard also has three dorms that are off campus Carver, Slowe, and Meridian.  Carver is located in a pretty bad area, and the condition of the building is pretty bad even for Howard.  Slowe is down the street from Carver, but yet it is not in that bad of an area (well not bad for NorthWest, DC), the rooms in Slowe are all singles which is a plus, but the rooms are not that appealing when it comes to looks, and you have to shower in \u201cshower closets\u201d, which are merely closets with showers in them, and they are quite disturbing when it comes to cleanliness.  Meridian is the last dorm and it is in a really nice area of DC called Columbia Heights, the only problem is that it is about 15 minutes away from campus and students usually take shuttles to get to campus, and you never know if the shuttles will be on time or too crowded.  Meridian is said to have pretty nice rooms, and it is conveniently close to many food places in Columbia Heights, Adams Morgan, Harris Teeter grocery store, and the Target most Howard students shop at.  None of the dorms are very safe for Howard students to leave their doors open, and I do not know many bold enough to do so.  ",

Freshmen are usually sorted into 6 of them (Quad, Annex, Drew, Carver, Cook, and Meridian). The Plaza Towers are for upperclassmen and graduate students. Mays Hall is for Divinity students. Both Mays and Meridian Halls are effectively off campus, the others are relatively close. The Quad, Drew Hall, Slowe Hall, and Carver Hall are traditional style (community) dorms. Cook Hall, Bethune Annex, and Plaza Towers are suite-style. The best dorms to live in depend on your preference. The most convenient dorms are the Bethune Annex, Cook Hall, and Plaza Towers.",

If your GPA is right, and your involved in campus, you will get enough RSVP points so you can battle with the rest of the university to get in one of the dorms, but living off campus after freshman year is not a bad thing. Freshman year, yes, you HAVE to live on campus because its all about getting to know people and getting into the swing of things. I'm a Quad girl till the day I die, T2 and We-3 (Truth Hall and Wheatly Hall), and one thing I would never EVER change is my freshman experience. The dorms aren't the prettiest, and sometimes it can get annoying dealing with the physical buildings, but its so worth it. Its only one year. ",

Most HBCU's student population include mostly African-American students, which sometimes comes with a separate set of stereotypes. However, with any ethnic group in America there are different \"types\" of people within that one ethnic conglomerate. Even though I am at a HBCU and our phenotype is similar, there are so many different personality types, style types, and individuals who come from so many different backgrounds. Therefore, it doesn't really feel like I go to a \"black school\". I feel like I am still in a very diverse school setting as if I were to attend The University of Southern California (which was my #1 university choice when applying for college, and diversity was my #1 university requirement). It is our thought process and intelligence that makes us so diverse. I even hate to refer to my school as a \"black school\" because I don't think that is what we are. Mainly because we are accepting to all ethnic groups and races. And secondly because we are not taught to limit ourselves or attach ourselves to any particular group or mindset. We are required to know our African-American history, but we are not allowed to use it as a crutch, but instead as a source of motivation to make a difference in the world today.",
                "Alexandria": "Howard campus is so diverse that you can't discriminate...we have people from every background, religion, and sexual orientation.  If you are a shy or conservative student you might feel out of place her, people at Howard are so outgoing. ",

The biggest presence are the Greeks (National Pan-Hellenic Council) and a premium is placed on some of their members. The non-conformist student would feel the most out of place because of the emphasis to fit in on campus. There are cliques like every other campus, but most people have a wide range of friends. You might see people of similar organizations (Greek, sports, band, etc.) or academic programs (theatre arts, business, allied health, etc) around each other more often. Howard is known for its fashion, so there is absolutely no pajama wearing to class. The culture will make you want to look your best at all times. It may seem as though many students come from wealthy families, but many more are from middle-class or low-income families.",
                "Darrian": "Students at Howard University are generally wonderful people.  Howard is a school of mostly Black individuals, but the diversity is just as good as a mixed university.  Students come from different, states, areas, financial backgrounds, social backgrounds, and have grown up with different mindsets, so the diversity of the school is great; Howard proves that not all people from the same ethnic background are the same.  To be perfectly honest I do not feel like any student would feel out of place at Howard, although it is majority Black, there are many different groups of people that any person can find a place to fit in on campus, minorities on Howard\u2019s campus are accepted the same as any other student, but it may take a little time for some students to get used to.  Howard is a school full of fashion obsessed individuals, students are constantly judged for what they wear, so it is safe to say you can wear anything on Howard\u2019s campus, and you just have to take things that other people say with a grain of salt and continue to be you.  Although Howard students are wonderful, intelligent and strong, many students are very closed minded when it comes to the people they interact with.  Many students are focused on the idea of having \u201ccool\u201d friends, fashionable friends, and many students on the campus do not accept other ethnicities when they first meet them.  It is not rare for Howard students who are down to earth and cultured to venture out in DC and explore friendships at the other local colleges and universities.  I am a person who likes to have different kinds of friends, so I do not take too much notice to the cliques that form around campus.  Howard does represent many different financial backgrounds, but in my opinion, the middle class is represented greatly.  Being Black and middle class is a great accomplishment, and many of the students at Howard are very material and object obsessed.  Some students are in college just to accomplish a certain financial and social status, while others are there to make a change and affect the world in a positive way.  With this said, Howard students are very aware and politically and socially active.  Most students on the campus are left winged individuals, which makes for rich human and civil rights based individuals at the institution.  ",

It doesn't matter if they are going to class or to the club, it has to be hair done, nails done, everything did.  Me personally, I'll wear sweats to class before anything else but hey...that's me.  There's a heavy presence of students from places like California (oakland, l.a.), Illinois (Chicago), and New York.  Everyone isn't the nicest person you will meet but you just have to go out and meet people and feel them out so you can build relationships with people who you will see for the next four or so years.",

Most kids are middle class.\r\n\r\nMost students \"dress-up\" for class. It's not uncommon to see guys in tailored suits and girls in the latest trends (or vintage). \r\n\r\nIt can be quite clique-y.

Howard is one of the few HBCU's that has an LGBT student organization. There are times where people from different backgrounds might conflict, but Howard immerses you in the diversity, which makes it a learning experience if you allow it open your mind. Howard students tend to politically aware, to different degrees. There are so many different view points that you are almost always guarenteed a fair debate amongst colleagues, Howard is a social enviroment, and students have a plethora of ways to interact and get to know each other.",

However, we are increasingly becoming more diverse with foreign exchange students and \"minorities.\" You will find that many of the students place a high value on fashion as a form of expression. We all come from different backgrounds and experiences, and you are able to be yourself  and find groups and organizations that appeal to your individual interests. \r\n\r\nOur students are some of the most politically aware that you will find. We join protests, fight for causes, and readily express our opinions on various issues. \r\n\r\nYou will also find that we are hardworking and are all striving to be the best in our relative career fields. If you're not competitive before you come here, you will certainly develop your drive while you're here. Seeing so many students chasing after their dreams is inspiring and makes you realize why you wake up everyday. We're all after something great. You start going after what you really want while you're in college.",

Sometimes it gets crazy because by senior year people really put themselves on celebrity status, however, its cool because it encourages competition and keeps people wanting to strive to be the best. Most people that go to Howard come from different socio-economic backgrounds; you have your son's and daughters of doctors and lawyers who are here on legacy scholarships, but you also have your small town people who are here to see what the big city is like for the first time. Its a very diverse university with so many different personalities. There are over 150 different organizations that allow students to find there niche and be the best at it; but at the end of the day, you still have to work to be on top. ",

It's widely known and successful alumni base as well is a big motivator to be successful and makes you proud to attend the same university as they once did.",

My dad came from Jamaica to attend Howard and from then it has been a family tradition. I love the history of Howard and the list of alumni who have gone on to make history. It inspires me even more to do the best I can because I know that those people were once in my shoes. Even though there is a lot that can be improved on campus, the Howard experience is incomparable.",

Additionally, being at this school my \"street\" senses are heightened, and I have become better at surveying my surroundings, especially when I am alone. The really unique thing about Howard, however, is the fact that the high exposure to culture just on campus is as much apart of the learning experience as the textbooks themselves.",
                "Briana": "I was looking for a school that I felt comfortable with but at the same time, I wanted to feel challenged. Howard University pushes students to realize that they are just a number on campus and the question becomes, \u201cwhat will you do to change that?\u201d Howard causes students to bring their creativity and aspirations to the campus for everyone to see. With other schools that I was considering, Howard stood out to be the school that would prepare me for the corporate world but also, would prepare me to tackle the rest of the world with determination and passion.",
                "Genessa": "This school is an HBCU (Historically Black College or University), but it is still remarkably diverse. Any other school that I would have gone to would have been primarily Caucasian with some Asians, some Latinos, and few African-Americans. At Howard, most of the students are black and that played a large part in why I wanted to come here. I'd never been exposed to so many people of my race and I thought I would feel a sense of belonging here that I wouldn't feel anywhere else.",
                "Rosa": "Howard Uniersity is pretty liberal, but there are definitely certain rules that are conservative compared to other schools. However, the rules and regulations are not so strict that they make student feeled babied or unable to do what they want. The open atmosphere makes people feel comfortable and they are many different types of people who atend the school in harmony. The social atmosphere of the school make it different from the other school I had applied to. I feel happy and free to live mylife without too many restraints or worrying that I will not fit in.",

                "Tiffany": "Howard is THE Historically Black College/University.  It has paved the way for many, many blacks.  It is the \"capstone\" for Negro education.  It's not a University that is easily described, it is something that one must experience.",

Everything you get at Howard, you have to work for it because it is very competitive. This applies to scholarships, financial aid, grades, and even clubs and orgranizations. This may sound like a negative, but I don't see it that way. On a brighter side, HU is right in the middle of the Nation's Capital, and also walking on our campus is like attending a free fashion show everday.",

Despite the institution being an Historically Black University it welcomes people from all walks of life, no matter their race and/or creed. Once committed to Howard it is hard to not realize the union everyone has. It is like a big family at Howard University; everyone is accepted regardless of the differences someone may have. The students/faculty/alumni of Howard are all cultivated people which allows them to be so open-minded.",
                "Morgan": "Howard has a very good reputation when it comes to the transistion from school to the professional field from their students.  With this reputation it allows for more opportunities to be presented to the current students from a very early stage.  This university also does a great job of facilitating many different outlets that one may be interested in no matter what field of study they are.",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "Those are the three words that you will say from the moment you first set foot on the campus till the day you walk across the stage, to the day you see your ultimate decision maker.

As some universities may offer activities to become a part of Howard University offers students a chance to become leaders of their own programs, organizations as well as groups. In such an opportunity it allows students to grow into the individuals they become and mold those who are following into the same footsteps. Our legacy has an efficient reputation that allows students to continue to carry it on through their academic studies as well as service to the community. A voice as a student is very important and heard.",
                "Mobosola": "Howard University is not made for the weak minded. Absolutely nothing is fed to you, anything and everything you attempt to accomplish is a challenge, big or small. While it is sometimes frustrating it instills in you a drive and hunger to succeed at whatever task you put ahead of yourself. At the end of the day if you are able to graduate from Howard, and conquer all the challenges you faced there is nothing you cannot do in the real world. If you can make it at Howard you can make it anywhere!",

The unique aspect about Howard University is that although it is a Historically Black  University, there are so many different types of people that go there. I grew up going to pretty diverse grade schools, and I can honestly say that Howard posseses more culturally diverse people then all of them combined. After my first year there, I have met so many different types of people from all around the world, which gives me such an advantage once I graduate and begin the job searching process.",

There's an immediate connection that you feel with the Howard community from students to faculty, it's like a family bond.  The same as family goes, members of the Howard community are genuine in their support and care for one another.  The fact that you're surrounded by other minorities who are doing tremendous things with themselves is a source of inspiration and pushes you to succeed just the same.",
                "Torry": "As an alumnus and faculty member (no former)I was shocked when I was told to establish gender based grading. When I complained to the institutional leadership and EEOC offices I was confronted with a disregard for student welfare and a hostile and harrassing work environment. As one of the only non-blacks on the faculty, I was equally shocked (as a male) to hear a hiring officil state in a public meeting that she would only hire a black, female for an anticipated job opening - it was my position that she referenced.",

Since Howard is an HBCU you can be assured that the campus is alive with history and African American culture. Howard is also a social campus, some days on the Yard there is music playing while students lounge, study, and enjoy the great weather. It is the place where friends meet or listen to someone trying to play their new demo. Aside from the social, Howard has amazing professors that are both eccentric and knowledgeable. They are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand.",

There are lots of students from all over the United States as well as International students. Howad University is a unique school because they have lots of opportunities for students and they reach out to students and encourage  them to seek the help they need to better themselves in their studies. Although college is viewed to many as a serious business that provides one with the foundation to excel in future aspiartions, they also create an area for down time and enjoyment.",
                "Chynna ": "My school is unique because it embaces not only the African-American culture, but the African culture as well. It allows African-American students who've never visited Africa to meet with students and teahers who reign from Africa. A lot of the English curriculum is basedaround the African/African-American culture and gives the students a sense of pride for their culture.",

Nestled in Washington DC, Howard University has exquisite views of the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument just to name a few.  Furthermore, Howard University has a diverse and dynamic campus life.  There are over 116 countries represented on its campus and 178 recognized campus clubs and organizations.  More importantly, academics remain a focus of Howard University.  It maintains prestige academically through spirited and well informed professors.  Where can you get diversity mixed with prestige? You cannot find it anywhere except Howard university.",

We have students from Nigiria, Trinidad, Russia, ect...Instead of standing out, the students at Howard University use out cultural differences to make our campus.

                "Lauren-Nikai": "I don't know too many people who truly type to negatively stereotype our students. Beside the fact that some people may think we aren't able to compete in a predominately white school (which is so not true), there isn't much people can say. \r\n\r\nHoward is known for being the best. We are the hilltop, the Mecca, the Capstone, its one of those places where negativity just isn't really welcome. I honestly wish I was able to tell you a negative stereotype of our student body but those are one of those things I'm somewhat ignorant of. ",
                "Jesse": "I think that the stereotype about being stuck up isn't really true and is an ideology spread mainly by dc natives who don't attend the school. It is definitely true that some people get caught up in dress up just to go to class....but that is not the majority. I will say however, Howard is not one of those schools where everyone wears pajamas and sweat pants to class.",
                "Logan": "1) For the most part, Howard students make an effort to look presentable. In the most extreme cases, you will see women sporting Gucci, Prada and the like; sometimes the men on campus try to give the women a run for their money in the fashion department.\r\n\r\n2) Howard is by no means the Black Harvard. There are brilliant students on campus, fine professors who will inspire any student, but you have to pick your department to find those professors and you have to search even harder to find someone who will discuss classroom texts outside of the classroom.  Sometimes I can feel my brain dissolving when I listen to certain people. I think it's fair to say that there isn't a very strong intellectual life on campus.\r\n\r\n3) There are plenty of horror stories such as the purging of hundreds of students earlier this year, causing them to be without housing and unable to attend classes because of error on the part of the administration. Personally, I haven't had anything of that sort happen to me, but I have had to call the health center about twenty times a day for a week because of a delay in processing my health records. Things can get pretty bad with the administration, but if you have your stuff together, you should be okay most of the time.",
                "Bevan": "The fashion stereotype is certainly true, but I feel that it sometimes overshadows the school's legitimate qualities. You will, however, see girls from the two freshman dorms trekking up the hill in heels. Some people dress liek they're going to the club to go to class.\r\n\r\nI believe the stereotype about us being elitist results from misunderstandings between students and people from Washington. While students of every socioeconomic level attend Howard, I believe most of us are from the suburbs and thus have to adjust to being in an urban environment. Resentment builds when residents assume we all have attitudes and we, in turn, assume they are all crazy or inferior. One detail: people from Washington don't appreciate being called \"locals,\" and students typically use this as a derogatory term.",
                "Alex": "The stereotype about Howard is somewhat correct in the fact that we are not only one of the best Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country, but we are also ranked amongst other colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nThe stereotype is not accurate about the students of Howard. We are not all rich or stuck up. Most of us are normal people who are on scholarship. We struggle and fight hard to get where we need to be and most of us were in the highest percentages at our high schools and were/are involved in many extracurricular activities. Many of us are leaders.",

During the weekdays we work hard, and on the weekends we play even harder!!\r\n\r\n2)Because the majority of the students attending Howard aren't local, trends are brought from across the nation. At Howard there is no such thing as \"what's hot and what's not\", as long as your attire expresses your personality its acceptable. So, just like a fashion show, you never know what's in store once you step on campus!!\r\n\r\n3)\"Sididy\" is quite harsh. However, Howard's students do have this heir about them. Now, this isn't because we look down on others. No, not at all!! The reason why is because of our unique teachings. At Howard, along with being taught the required curriculum, students are also taught self-appreciation. Therefore, we walk with our heads high!!\r\n\r\n4)Along with producing some of the most prominent African Americans known today, and being the alpha chapter of seven of the divine nine, and being one of the most prestigious historically black university's, yes, Howard is also known for its homecoming.

A lot of the people are pretty snotty, but then again there are some down-to-earth folk. The majority of the student body does seem to think that they're heading to an America's Next Top Model audition, rather than class, and many seem to disregard the weather forecast when choosing their outfit du jour. As many older Howardites, DC residents, and other notable people have criticized, the current student body is nowhere near as active in the community or for important causes as Howardites of the past. But they do pretend to be by traveling in \"mighty\" packs of 50 or so to places like New Orleans or Jena, Louisiana, the National Mall or government buildings, and creating protests and rallies which they believe are creating some sort of impact. A lot of students here begin to embody an almost 'Black supremacist' persona while at Howard, and some even begin to sport Afros, dreads, and dashikis, and get tattoos of ankhs or some sort of symbol of the motherland and wear Black Power fists usually by the middle of sophomore year...",

After dating this different list of guys on our campus and all but a select two have proven to be genuinely about a females friendship, patience is barely visible.... keeping hope alive is as chilling as a death sentence, lol Not really but a lot f females WILL NOT deal with a guy from Howard...

                "Dominique": "One of the stereotypes about Howard is that it is a party school. True. There is a party often(One or two a week via club and several within the dorm rooms) where clubs solicit students in numerous ways on and off campus, but of course it is the students' decision as to whether or not they would attend. The female to male ration is high, something like 4-1(Not exact, but roughly), which make the guys a hot commodity, but not really because a lot of them are supposedly gay. That stereotype is based off of style and demeanor which can be misconstrued by most people inside and outside the Howard community. Both the men and women of Howard dress well according to East coast style; another stereotype of the University. It can be true, but again, that's subject to one's interpretation of \"style\". Of course, not EVERY person can dress, but for the most part, you'll see some pretty interesting and diverse sites while sitting on \"The Yard\" during the summer or winter seasons. Homecoming can be poppin, but recently it's been hit or miss. May get a noteworthy celebrity at an event or two, but for the most part, the students are who make the homecoming what it is. Our school spirit is reflected MOST during that week in October.   \r\n\r\nAcademically speaking...ummm...the prestige of Howard academia now remain in the Grad schools. I adore the School of Business and would like to have had other classes in other schools on campus, but the general consensus from some of the students I have talked to is that the curriculum is not challenging enough University wide. I was challenged more at Whitney Young Magnet High School in Chicago prior to attending Howard University, which ultimately became a problem for me. It doesn't take much to make the grade, which shouldn't be the case. One should work hard to get good grades, as opposed to doing the bare minimum and passing. Currently, the University is in the process of fixing this issue, but due to its resonance throughout the campus, it WILL take some time. You have great professors and you have not so great professors. The problem is that the ration of one to the other is not favorable to the students or the legacy of the university. Rankings of HBCUs show that Spellman is #1 now and Howard is #2.",

The meal plans give you access to the main cafeteria (Blackburn), the Punch-Out eatery, and the Annex cafeteria. The cafeterias are leave much to be desired. There are staples such as burgers, pasta, sandwiches, salads and burritos; the main dish changes daily. The Punch-Out eatery is only slightly better with sandwich, pasta, wings/burgers, and chinese stations. There are a few convenience stores to make quick purchases and there is also a restaurant for \"fine dining\". Overall the food is edible but would probably be better elsewhere. Around campus, your options are limited to McDonalds, Subway, Potbelly's, and Starbucks, to name a few. More quality food will require you to travel or cook yourself.",
                "Theara": "I gained about 20 lbs actually. The cafeteria in Blackburn is where most freshman eat. The food is hit or miss, but it's one of the social havens your first year at Howard. Most upperclassmen eat in the Punchout, but there's plenty of fast food if you like.\r\n\r\nHo-Chi is legendary for their wings and mambo sauce. The store looks gross, but the food is pretty good :)",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "So freshman year, you buy your typical meal plan and you eat in the cafeteria. WHBC comes in now and again with a DJ to turn it up during midterms and other random times, but the food is cool. Its catered by Sodexo, they have the sandwich line, pizza, burgers, fries, the typical college food. The Cafe does have a Soul Food Thursdays where they do fried chicken, greens, cornbread and the good home cooked food; that's always cool. \r\n\r\nSophomore year, when your tired of the cafe, you upgrade your life to Dining Dollars and you eat in the punchout. The punchout is more like fast food restaurants, we have different chains like Magic Johnson, Wild Wings, and a sushi spot. That's cool if you still want to be in the social scene and see your classmates when you eat. \r\n\r\nAfter sophomore year, its a combination of the punchout, Georgia Ave, and the food in your fridge, and the food you can get when you have a few dollars left in your bank of account. We give the most of our money to Howard McDonalds which I think is one of the most lucrative McDonald's on the eat coast next to Manhattan; we have Potebelly's which is under wonderful management and is a cool hangout spot, China Wonder, and Subway. So the options become monotonous in four years, but we make due.   "

These professors for real host a lecture class of 100 students and read through all of the essays the assign and mark them up so you can get better. Very few professors here don't take their job seriously. They are here because they want to be and they are here because they understand the importance of the students at Howard. They make themselves accessible and a lot of them are doing so well in their actual profession, as a student you can get the opportunity to work right along side of them to get the experience that you truly want.

We always get albums before they come out and reviews are always posted on blogs and sites (check out www.whbc830am.com to review the new albums from Wale and Drake) and we even have so much inside talent that we always have to promote the people who are doing their thing on campus. \r\n\r\nWe are also always talking about current events, and what's going on inside out culture and society, however, if you want to know what gets us hot, name an album or a new line that's about to come out.

                "Christian": "Guess we will find out in the Fall",
                "Eboni": "I am in the School of Communications at Howard University. The classes are not too big and not too small, therefore, I am given an equal amount of time and attention with my professors. Howard as a whole is a very competitive school, with many of its students being at the top of their classes in high school. Howard also incorporates a lot of African/African-American studies in their curriculum, being a Historically Black University. I feel that I not only learn about my field of interest, but also my history and ancestors too. There are many teachers who take pride in what they do, which also makes me want to learn. I feel that while my classes may not always be easy, they are definitely interesting and worth taking. ",
                "Olivia": "Academics at Howard have bred a confidence in me that I would never have had without it. The teachers are caring, they know my name, they are interested in meeting with the students all the time, they're so accessible. The education at Howard is definitely geared towards getting a good job. I have learned so many skills that I would be otherwise ignorant to because of my university. I am receiving a one of a kind education that is not only preparing me for success in the classroom, but there real world, too.",
                "Alexandria": "Professors know your name for the most part, not so much in large lecture classes\r\nFavorite class, Anatomy. least favorite Organic Chemistry 1\r\nstudying depends on how many days you want to party, some people start on thursday\r\nstudents constantly have intellectual conversation, we are very opinionated\r\nstudents hustle for everything, we always compete\r\nMy major is sports Medicine and I love it\r\n\r\n",
                "Caleb": "Howard University has a lot of great professors. I've only had one bad professor in my two years at the school, but I got an A in the class (Political Science). A lot of my professors encourage class participation by starting excellent debates and discussions. Sometimes we wouldn't even have a lecture because the discussion got so good.\r\n\r\nI'm studying film production and so far all of my professors in the Communications department have been great. They're all very knowledgeable and passionate about the art. They are also very accessible.",
                "Kaylynn": "No matter the class or subject, black history will some way be incorporated. The classes are usually 20-35 students and the professors know your name. Talk with other students and use online review websites to help you choose classes and professors. Try to stay away from TBA professors. All of my professors in the past have been accessible through e-mail or during their office hours for extra help in the class. Some professors really try to structure the class for \"learning for its own sake\" but many students make it about receiving the A.  ",
                "Nicole": "The quality of academics depends on the department, but the requirements are usually manageable. In my major, Psychology, the classes are intensive (but not as bad as Biology or Chemistry or Business) and professors are usually willing to get to know you. Students here are very competitive - for grades, research experiences, internships, and scholarships. Everyone wants to make a name for themselves. There is no room for slackers here. The education here is geared to prepare you for life after graduation (either a job or graduate school). Most classes are lecture-based and class participation is low. Few classes are interactive and/or discussion based, but students usually appreciate those classes the most.",
                "Darrian": "I feel like the quality of academics at Howard depends on your department.  My departments, the School of Communications and the English department are wonderful, and provide the students with more than just classroom success, but also real life professional experience.  General education requirements are probably the same as any other college or university, very crowded and broad, but once you get into your specific major, and minor, the classes become smaller, and very intimate.  Classes within your major and minor at Howard are very hands on, the teachers get the students involved, and furthering outside knowledge is vital to succeeding in class.  Just like any other school, the amount of studying and intellectual conversation that takes place depends on the students themselves.  Most students at Howard are very intelligent, and are not afraid to show it, but there are students that a simply there to just get a piece of paper and move on.  The students that do care about their education are very competitive, and pride themselves on being the best students and most qualified professionals they can be.  Once you get to your major and minor, you will get to know your professors very well, and have them various times before you graduate, it is vital to form a positive relationship with you professors, because at Howard the professors will only respect you if you respect them and show them you are worth their time.  If you form a good bond with your professors they will be more than happy to help you inside and outside of the classroom including, recommendations, and extra help.  Overall I feel the education at Howard is what you make it.  If you are open and willing to learn and expand your mind intellectually, then you will find the education at Howard to be very substantial.  ",
                "Brianna": "Professors know your name and are involved in making you a better student and person. Class participation depends on how the professor engages students. Students do have intellectual conversations outside of class. Students are very competitive with grades and internship opportunities. I'm a marketing major and dance minor and it has been very interesting. Education is geared to success, in whatever endeavor one chooses. ",
                "Lisa": "Academics are pretty standard I would say compared to other universities.  So far I haven't received any unique training in classes but the experience you have really depends on the professors you take.  Please use ratemyprofessor.com.  It will save you the trouble of having to drop a class midway through the semester.  The best classes I've taken since Ive been here are Black Thought in the Diaspora with Dr. Gregory Carr, Priniciples of Speech with Professor Christopher Jackson, and Accounting Principles I with Professor Lesia Quamina (Accounting is my major). Don't leave Howard University without taking a class by Dr. Carr, it will change your life.  Take the time to develop a relationship with your professors, it will make a difference.  ",
                "Jennifer": "The college of Engineering in particular has a very rigorous curriculum. Most Engineering students hardly find time to do anything besides school work.",
                "Mariah": "Do not let any of the rumors fool you about Howard being a party school.  The same people you see in the club are the same people in the library and by the end of the year are walking out with a 4.0 GPA.  We WORK hard for our grades and the professors rarely cut us any slack.  Majority of these professors have their Ph.D and they treat us like we are getting ours. Be prepared!",
                "Jane ": "There are 7,000 undergraduate students. Most classes are relatively small. The 15:1 student teacher ratio is very accurate. Your professors will know you by name & not your student number. Although every professor teaches differently, you can expect open dialogue in a lot of your classes. \r\n\r\nI took an Education in Black America class taught by Dr. Carr (probs one of the best professors on campus). We spent every class going over the works of WEB DuBois, Booker T. Washington and the founders of HBCUs. John Legend even provided a guest lecture.",
                "Theara": "It all depends on what your major is and what particular school you are in. From what I gather, School of Communications and School of Business Advisors are a little more hands on than some of the College of Arts and Sciences advisors. The classes themselves are, once again, touch and go. Some are more challenging than others. There are some excellent teachers here at Howard across the board, and some mediocre teachers. \r\n\r\nThe education you get is wholistic. You get exposed to things that simply spark your interest, as well as to necessary skill sets for your chosen career paths.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that everyone take a class with Dr. Gregory Carr, and Professor Tony Medina if they have the chance. Both of these men have left lasting impressions on me academically, and are generally percieved to be amongst the most popular classes to take at HU.",
                "Kiah": "One thing that I appreciate about Howard is their emphasis on understanding where you come from and African-American history. Some of the best classes that you take may not even be in your major, and I would encourage you to explore as many as you can. \r\n\r\nAs with any school you get teachers who really care about your education and you as a student. These are the teachers that make a big deal about you coming to class on time, turning in your homework, offer extra sessions for you to understand the subject, etc. You also get those who appear not to be concerned about the value of your education. It's not unique to Howard. You will find that at any school. ",
                "Nia": "Academics at Howard really depend on the major. Some are more intensive and personal due to small amounts of students, such as Art, while others are more like a traditional large university due to high numbers of students, like Political Science. \r\n\r\nOverall, professors are very helpful and willing to meet with students during office hours to help them succeed and give advice. \r\n\r\nMy favorite class has been digital photography, because I was able to express myself through photos and learn about digital cameras in depth and programs such as Photoshop. The African-American course requirement broadens many students' view on the world and causes for intense debates inside and outside of the classroom. It is an academic environment for challenging beliefs and expressing one's opinions in a mature, healthy setting. \r\n\r\nThrough Howard's different programs, such as the CEDAR center, students can get help in securing jobs and internships. This school prepares students for so much when it comes to the real world, and Howard students have a distinct aura about them that only this school can provide. ",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "Howard is a good size school where you have a range from your standard lecture classes to your smaller concentrated classes. Howard is big on the fundamental skills of education; even though we may wish we had smartboards in all of our classes and the latest technology, you are at least given the basic skills that allow you to gain your competitive edge in society. As in life, you take from a class what you put in; some people may see classes as boring because a lot of them are text book oriented, however, if you are the type of student that is willing to speak up and start class discussion the world is yours. We have amazing professors who show that they love us and its a family at the end of the day. When it comes to the literal education, it truly depends on the individual to take away what they want from the experience. ",
                "Jesse": "For its size, I think Howard, does a good job of keeping its class sizes fairly low. My largest class was Spanish, which had maybe 40 people in it, while my smallest class had 5. I never had problems getting one on one attention from professors when I needed it. My anthropology professors were passionate and knowledgeable and knew all the majors by name. Intellectual discourse among students is common in and outside of the classrooms.",
                "Logan": "One thing that a professor always tells me is, \"Howard offers a great education if you pick the right department.\" Two of the better departments are English and Classics. The English department regularly sends graduates to top law schools i.e, Yale and Georgetown, while the Classics department produced Howard's last Rhodes Scholar. From my experience, my professors have emailed me to ask why I've missed class and ask me to come to office hours to talk about anything from how I'm adjusting to Howard to the finer points of the Iliad. The math department gets a pretty bad rep because of its many foreign teachers. Howard has a lot of preprofessional majors such as actuarial science, communications, and sports medicine. The preprofessionalism spills over to the mindset of the students. You will find classmates asking \"What can you do with your degree?\" rather than \"What are you reading?",
                "Alex": "The academics at Howard are outstanding. In my school, the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Computer Sciences, the curriculum is very challenging. The professors work with you only as well as you work with them. Most of them are willing to communicate with you on a one-on-one basis in order to help you learn and understand the coursework. I believe that the education at Howard is geared toward getting a job. The university holds Career Fairs in which students approach representatives from their possible career choices.",
                "Bobby": "Howard is known as a academic school so it would be a understatement to say that the howard admin takes academics very seriously. Howard will kick you out in a heart beat if your messing up with classes. So try to keep your gpa up there so that you won't be faced with that problem. I have to say that there are some great professors here who will truly inspire you that it is possible for you to do great things. I actually recommend reading rate my professor.com before picking your classes. It will give you all the dirt on the professor and help you to pick the class thats right for you.",
                "Alicia": "Some professor's will know your name(whether you want them to or not), while other's will tell you flat out that they have no desire to get familiar with anyone. Some restrict student/teacher interaction to the classroom while others really extend themselves. Some teachers who I've enjoyed are Dr. Ian Smart(Humanities), Dr. Greg Carr, Dr. Jules Harrell & Dr. Alfnso Campbell(Psych), Dr. Hakim Rashid(Human Dev.), Prof. Carol Beane(Spanish), Prof. Senhui Chen(Math), Prof. Darren Conrad(Econ), Prof. Paul Logan(German), Caroline Dexter(Classics), Prof. Cevallos(Spanish)... the list goes on.  One of THE worst teachers is Dr. Janis Brown(Statistics) and most of the Math Department sucks too. Intellectual conversations are inevitable at Howard, in and out of the classrooms, but so ar ignorant conversations. Students are kind of competitive, but not overly. The most unique class I've taken was probably Intro to Humanities w/ Dr. Smart(whom I absolutely adore!), where you learn less about conventional humanities, and more about Howard and life in general. The academic requirements are somewhat ridiculous, especially for the College of Arts & Science(Swimming???). But I do think Howard prepares you for a good future.",
                "robYn": "The professors know they're students names and that is a definite plus.  My favorite class is social theory and society and my least favorite was algebra.  Class participation is very common and it really shows the competiveness of the students in those classes.",
                "Denise": "Depending on the size of the course, teachers know students' names.  Some classes will have ten people while others will have over 200.",
                "Bevan": "Besides some of the classes freshmen are required to take (like math) and phys ed courses like swimming, the classes are generally small. This semester, there are four people in my smallest class and about 15 in my largest.\r\n\r\nI'm an English major and a print journalism minor, so I'm in the College of Arts and Sciences but also take classes in the School of Communication. I haven't really felt all that enlightened by my English courses or figured out how all these classes are supposed to mesh together to give me some kind of cohesive notion of what I'm getting a degree in. I will say that I have been exposed to a lot of literature I probably never would have found on my own, especially by black writers. However, our journalism program is excellent and I feel like I'm learning a lot in my minor. Our professors are actual journalists, and it's nice to learn from people who actually do what they teach.",
                "Carson": "Yes, if you get to know them first. I dont have any favorite clasees but my least favorite was Bio 101. I hated it. The building was in very poor condition, no air conditioning it was always hot or cold, and half of all the chiars were broken. It made it very hard to learn. \r\nStudents dont study very often. Class participation is common among zealous students.\r\nYes, they do. In fact there was this big stir in Lock Hall when a few got to gether and were talking about religion...the group grew large as passers by joined in. Students are competitive and for no reason it seems. Being a freshman, there's no reason to be competitive because if we both get A's nothing happends. If I fail and you dont, still, nothing happends.",
                "Dominique": "a) It depends. If you are a good student, the professor will know your name. If you're a butt kisser, they'll know your name then too. If you do nothing, well hey, they may still know your name. Lol! b)my favorite class was Business Orientation. It provided all the basics I needed for my career pursuit. c) That's the problem, STUDENTS DON'T STUDY. A handful may, but typically, there is not a need to. Maybe some classes, but definitely not most. d) Class participation is common, especially in classes where professors are able to evoke the students' interest e) YES! When do they NOT have intellectual conversations?! No, but really, the students on HU's campus, discuss a number of topics, from politics to student advocacy, all of which sound so invigorating when listening in. Realistically speaking, some students don't talk about things like that, but for the most part they do. f) Students don't need to be competitive; Everyone has their own path.  Compete in class, maybe, but not likely. g) The most unique class I took, again was Business anything my freshman year. The program that new entrants into the School of B must take is unique and there is no other of its kind in the nation. g) I was an Insurance Major with a concentration in Actuarial Science. It is a heavily analytical study with a business background. I associated best with the business portion and changed my major this year to Finance(at another University, but I'll explain that later). My department was Finance/International Business/Insurance, but possibly the most efficient as it dealt heavily with Investment Banks and has the most students. h) I didn't, other students may have. I spent a lot of time with different Directors of programs due to my affiliation with them. They may have taught some classes, but were not faculty, of course. i) Howard's standards are low. They should make the standards higher in order to recruit a more attentive and academically focused student body. j) Both. Again, the School of B is geared towards getting students a job by the end of their 4 years. Other schools may offer that too, but I don't know about the capacity to which they work towards that. On the other hand, students attend for the learning's sake as well."

It's an amazing class that will challenge you and take your writing to the next level.",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "So, if you come to Howard you have to take a class by Dr. Carr. He teaches Intro to African-American Studies, Hip-Hop, Black Poetry and Lit, and a few other classes. He is amazing. I'm in his class now, and if you want a professor that has a crazy amount of energy and love for his craft and a ridiculous amount of knowledge but knows how to break it down in a way of which you can understand...this is the person you go to. You want to know the truth about your history? This is the person who can tell you. He writes most of the literature we go through, but offers so many more people that you can gain knowledge on.  Whatever your major is, there is always something to be learned in this class. He's the best that we have at Howard, students love him, he loves us, and its just a great relationship. "

The University Campus Pals are popular amongst the freshmen, as they help them move in and become acclimated to the college scene. The \"Blue Crew\" is also a popular group, as they help cheer on the sports teams during games and sometimes travel with them in support. There are plenty of other organizations as well dealing with religious life, Greek life, sports, state clubs and other aspects of school. At Howard there is pretty much an organization for anything that you can think of. This makes it easier to find people who have similar interests as you and helps you feel as though you \"fit in.\"",

It's the most exciting time of the year, next to graduation. Athletic events are not well attended because our teams do not win as much. Whenever there are celebrities or important national figures visiting campus, you can guarantee a packed auditorium/stadium/building/etc. Every event is a party. There is usually a DJ and dancing during every intermission. Students party hard every weekend, and sometimes during the week. There is about a 2 to 1 ratio of girls to guys on campus, so not many people date. Some relationships do blossom, though. Friendships are strongest during frosh years, afterwards students become busy with classwork and extracurriculars. There are plenty of activities to do off campus, like poetry ciphers, concerts, museums, parks, and movies.",
                "Darrian": "1.)\tHoward University is known for its student organizations and activities.  The most popular organizations would have to be divine nine fraternities and sororities, academic organizations (ex. Mock Trial), community service organizations (ex. NAACP), and the well known state clubs (ex. Cali Club).  I have been involved in community service organizations and the California Club.  Howard University has a club for anything you want to do, whether it be social, for fun, or for service.  2.)  Howard University is not located in the best of areas, so students typically will not leave their dorm doors open. 3.)  Athletics are not very big at Howard University, many students will only go the sporting events to see the dance teams or Howard University Showtime Marching band perform.  Guest speakers are very big at Howard.  Howard regularly has big named speakers (ex. Bill Cosby, Michelle Obama), and frequently has surprise speakers, that will come and speak in classrooms (ex. John Legend).   4.)  Dating scene at Howard is a little messy; Howard has about seven girls to every guy, so a lot of the time you will find a guy dating more than one female around campus.  5.)  Procrastination is a common theme at Howard, so if I am awake at 2am on a Tuesday I am probably eating take out and trying to finish an assignment due the next day, just like many of my fellow classmates.  6.)  Howard has a lot of yearly events the biggest ones being the famous Howard University Homecoming week, ResFest (where the dorms compete against each other in various events), Spring Fashion Show, Commencement ( famous speakers each year.) , and Probates ( induction of new members into divine nine frats and sororities).   7.)  Howard is a very big party school and many students will make up any excuse to party.  It is not rare to have individuals who party Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  It is also not rare to have people partying in the middle of campus on a sunny day.  Many students are also seen frequently in the DC nightlife.  You should never be bored on the weekends if you attend Howard.  8.)  Fraternities and Sororities are very important on Howard\u2019s campus.  The divine nine are the original Black fraternities and sororities, and they are taken very seriously, they are not your traditional frats and sororities, they are more about brotherhood and sisterhood (although they still party, if not harder than most students).  Howard also has many community service fraternities and sororities also, that are really respected on campus.  9.)  If you do not drink you can do research and find things to do, it is a college campus there is bound to be others who do not drink, and you are in Washington DC one of the most known cities in the nation, you are bound to find things you enjoy that do not require you to drink.  10.)  There are a lot of things to do off campus if you are 21, DC caters to the 21plus crowd, if you are not there are still things you can do such as downtown, visit the monuments go to Bus Boy\u2019s and Poets, and many more things.

For those really interested in service there are multiple opportunities to get involved in the community, and for those interested in politics SGA is for you. \r\n\r\nWhile we work hard and get involved on campus, you really get a unique experience your freshman year. Beyond the house parties and clubs, you can participate in Rest Fest, which is a battle of the dorms in sports, dance, step, and debate. It's a fun way to meet some of your closest friends. You will spend hours practicing and really getting to know your fellow teammates.\r\n\r\nSports and intramurals are also a way to get involved and stay active on campus. \r\n\r\nYou'll get the most experiences with the friends you make. Beyond my on campus and off campus involvement, I really had the most fun and the best learning experiences through the adventures with my friends. We met freshman year on move-in day.

If one is not necessarily looking to be Greek there are so many other things to get involved with. We have a radio station that is 24/7 365 and student run (I am the current General Manager) we have a published newspaper which is online and prints twice a week (the Hilltop), dorm organizations, and so many other things. Many students enjoy regular night life of going over to Georgetown, sometimes Adams Morgan, Columbia heights, or just the regular house parties that are always going on.

On weekends, you will find thousands of flyers for house parties, club parties, and the like strewn across walkways, lampposts, and bulletin boards. Aside from that, it's pretty difficult to find something to do on campus if you are not into the party scene. There is plenty to do in the city however - shopping in Georgetown, movies in Chinatown, and there are the Smithsonian museums and monuments on the Mall which is an essential experience for any student in the District to have.",
                "Alex": "There is always something to do on or around Howard's campus. The athletic events are pretty popular. The marching band performs and the teams play their hardest (sometimes to no avail). There are always shows and concerts going on. You can walk to Adams Morgan from campus and listen to some jazz or go to a bar or a club. There are always club parties pretty much everyday out of the week. The Greek life on Howard's campus is very strong being that the Alpha Chapter of most of the Divine 9 are at Howard. But other fraternities and sororities also do a lot around campus. There is Phi Sigma Pi, Delta Sigma Pi, Tau Beta Sigma, Kappa Kappa Psi, Phi Mu Alpha, Sigma Alpha Iota, Alpha Phi Omega, Alpha Nu Omega, Gamma Sigma Sigma, and so many more. \r\n\r\nThere are also so many more activities/clubs on Howard's campus including The Gospel Choir, the Jazz Choirs (Afro Blue and A Whole Lotta Jazz), Gentlemen of Drew and Ladies of the Quad Social Clubs, the NAACP, NSBE, etc.",
                "Bobby": "Like I stated before there is always something to do. There is a club for everyone to join because it is just that many and one truly has to have the same interest that you do. The social life is great. There is always something to do. You can count on having club and house parties every weekend if thats something that you want to do. Also as a freshmen you don't have to worry about not having a car because a shuttle will probably pick you up in fornt of the freshmen dorm to take you to the club.  If your not a person who likes to party thats fine just hop on the metro and you can find plenty of other things to do in the city such as going to musems or just sight seeing. What ever you desire trust me its here.",
                "Emmerson": "Besides the Greeks, of course, one of the most popular organizations on campus is this group known as the Campus Pals. This organization is devoted to mentoring the freshmen and  making sure they start their semester off with a blast! I love being apart of the Mecca Mob!! This organization is devoted to supporting Howard's athletics. We attend all of the games and cheer on our team. Our support makes a difference in the pace of the game....it's always OUR pace!! Some of the dorms can be real secluded because they're suits, so in order to socialize, students often keep their doors open to their suit to let others know they're welcomed. In the athletics department, depending on the game, some sports are more popular than others. It's the same way with the plays and theater acts, attendance is usually determined by what's being showcased. However, Howard always has great guest speakers, so that's always sold out!! Unfortunately, the dating scene at Howard is pretty casual. Not too many people have boyfriends/girlfriends. People tend to have something that is known as a \"boo\". A boo is a person who is looking for a good time, not a title. I randomly met the greatest girls in the world one night when we were on our way to the club. We were talking about our freshmen expierence and discovered that we stayed in the same buliding, and we've been sisters every since!! Facebook is addictive!! If I'm up at 2am, which I usually am, I'm always logged on Facebook....it's part of the college experience!! Greeks are extremely important on Howard's campus. Howard is the alpha chapter of seven of the Divne Nine. They demand respect and recognition....besides they are the FIST!! Friday night is usually my party night. Saturday is always girls night out!! My friends and I usually shop, eat, then catch a movie. A majority of the shopping, eating out, and partying takes place off campus. So, basically we do everything off campus....we even have dorms off campus!!",
                "Alicia": "There's groups for everyone. Some people will try and transform themselves just to fit in to certain groups and organizations. Most of the people involved in groups, allow that group to define who they are... Don't just leave your doors open in dorms. It's just not a good idea. Athletic events aren't that popular. Football's probably the most popular, but it's still not that exciting. We do have al ot of guest speakers and special events, but they usually aren't highly publicized, so you always have to keep your ears and eyes open or you may miss out. A lot of people date and hook up, but relationships aren't that big. I met my closest friends freshman year living in the freshman girl's dorm, but I always am meeting new people too. Homecoming's obviously the biggest event, and it's always fun, but doesn't always meet everyone's expectations. Greek Life is a pretty big deal, seeing as how we have a lot of alpha chapters, but it seems like its more for association than actual activism. This past weekend, I went to a bar with my friends, went shopping and out to eat, chilled at the house, and contemplated the club. There's plenty of things to do besides drink, it just depends what you're into. I work off campus, go to the malls, go out to eat and drink, hang out with non-Howard friends, go to concerts and other special events, etc.",
                "robYn": "A lot of greek sorities and Fraternities were started at HU therefore they are a very big aspect of life at Howard.  There are also a lot of concerts and activities that occur throughout the year.  Guest speakers are always here as well.  Howard is located in a college town also so there are things to do at other schools as well.",
                "Denise": "Greek life plays a nig role on the campus.  Students support teams but they are not very successful.  From presidential candidates to music moguls, the campus is always flocking with students.  On a saturday, there are so many things to do.  You can go out to Chinatown or the movies or to a club.",
                "Bevan": "Most of the Divine Nine (the preeminent black fraternities and sororities) were founded at Howard, so Greeks have an imposing presence on campus. A lot of people strategically join certain organizations to get in the good graces of certain Greeks.\r\n\r\nThere's a healthy party scene, with at least a few house parties within walking distance each weekend. Fliers for club parties are a familiar sight under dorm doors. For people who don't like to party, there are plenty of on-campus events and arts & culture things to find in D.C.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of numbers floating around about the male-to-female ratio, but it's understood that women far outnumber men, and many say this has a negative effect on the dating prospects for women.",
                "Carson": "Sororities and Faternities are the most elite and sacred groups on campus. It depends on when dorm on stays in. In some dorms all the rooms are on the hall so it's kind of like a forced open door policy but in some dorms there are suites so, it's more isolated. I met my closest friends in high school. If i'm awake at 2am I'm probably on facebook or studying, or watching a movie. Homecoming is a big thing that happends each year, and Res Fest where each dorm compete's in several games against other dorms. We just had a guest speaker, Angela Davis. Bill Cosby, Barack Obama, and many others also came this year. \r\nD.C. has a life of it's own, there are many clubs one could attend, Chinatown, Goeorgetown, and Adams Morgan is close by. One can always go to a restaurantm a jazz show, a museum, a play or something. There is a lot to do in this city.",
                "Dominique": "a) The most popular groups or campus are Greek affiliated. Whether they are academically, service, or socially oriented, one is sure to be proud of an affiliation with either. b)I was involved with a much smaller group which was tailored towards insurance students, of which we had few. My experience does not give an accurate depiction of what it is like campus-wide. c)No. A student should NEVER leave his or her things open in their dorms. I did, once I was opened up to my floor, but that was only when I was on the floor during the time when I may not have been in my room. d) Athletic events are not as popular. e) Speakers on the other hand are as Barack Obama spoke at the 141st Convocation for the University for 2007. That was important for obvious reasons. Theater is in between as the students in the Fine Arts School often put on events. I am unsure as to the attendance of most of their events.  f) I'm unsure, I dated, but do not think I can give an accurate recurrence of that situation either on behalf of the University. g) I met my closest friends by holding them from high school and carrying them to college with me. The newer come from our participation in similar activities. h)If I'm awake at 2am, I'm probably eating the pizza I ordered while hurriedly writing a 10 page paper due the following day next to some peers in the same situation, Lol! i) Lots, too many to point out...I'm sure there's something for everyone. j) People party d$^m near everyday. Students are always ready to have fun, k)Fraternities and Sororities are extremely important as 5 of the Divine 9 were founded at the Historical University. l) We'll discuss that shortly, as I no longer attend the University as of a month ago) m) Anything. It's DC and options are limitless. Find somewhere you want to be and just go!(the freedom of being in college) n) I did whatever I wanted off campus. To list things wouldn't begin to give an idea as they are so random. I just...did.",
                "Marie": "The social life is the best part of Howard's campus. Why? Because there is so many people who are fun, goal-oriented, unique, and just cool. I have met many interesting people at Howard University and plan to continue meeting such wonderful people. I have met people who promote different venues for different clubs around the DC area, met and connected with people who govern our student body, met people who just make me laugh and much more. As a busy person that I am, I have seen and heard it all. A new club just opened and the promoter wanted me to be there. No problem. A new event was posted in the Hilltop for Black History Month and needed volunteers. I spread the word around or asked how many people they needed and what time to be there. Sure there are many things to do at Howard. Are you a Poli Sci major, love politics, and are intrigued by the Presidential Election, then join College Dems or College Reps? These are some of the slogans and messages that get tossed around whether through WHBC Channel 51 (student radio show and broadcast), The Hilltop (daily and only black collegiate newspaper printed daily), through events posted on Facebook, or by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nI am currently part of a great organization on Howard: the National Council of Negro Women. It is a great organization and I am very proud of what we have done this year so far. We have staged programs geared to the Howard community: True Life: I'm a Freshman, I'm a Black Woman, I'm a Black Man; helping the community through tutoring neighboring DCPS Cardozo Senior High School; volunteering for the AIDS Walk and Helping the Homeless Walk and many other things. There is something for everyone here at Howard. Student government, community service, state clubs, National Honor Societies, Community service Sororities and Fraternities, Departmental clubs and organizations, Sororities and Fraternities, sports, intermural sports, health clubs, national memberships to service organizations, Non-profit groups, theater, dance, campus ambassador, tour guide, Homecoming Steering Committee volunteer or chair coordinator, and many more. There is really no excuse to not join and be a part of something great.\r\n\r\nThe best part of Howard: Homecoming!!! Yes, that's right. Everyone wants to be about it, a part of it, and continuously talk about it when fall arrives. And even before the next year, so we can outdo last year! I love it faithfully. As Howard was mentioned as part of Ludacris song ft. Bobby Valentino, \"Pimping All Over the World\" with the most famous line \"...not to miss the Homecomings at Howard\", it gave Howard more of a edge. As known for having the most outrageous parties and vendors and for having big celebs such as Tyson Beckford, LL Cool J, Ludacris, Ice Cube, and many others, people just simply love our Homecoming. Is it because Howard University is the Mecca of HBCU's or is it because we do it bigger and better like no other campus around. Whatever it is, Howard has got it. Howard has produced many bright scholars, doctors, thespians, actors, writers, researchers, and many other professions. It is why the legacy of Howard continues and thrives since its birth in March 1867.\r\n\r\nAs a person who loves to know what is going on around campus, I read the Hilltop daily and love the comic pieces. I enjoy being in a great organization (NCNW) and School of Business (no matter how many times I have to dress conservatively for an interview and deal with the gruesome/tiresome/stress-related courseload). But I do love it. There is always something to do every weekend and every week whether that be partying at the best club on the planet (LOVE Nightclub) or participating in the can food drive or Stop-the-Violence Benefit or being part of the Blood Drive or being on the yard (non-stop chilling) or whatever. Just get involved and be part of Howard's legacy!"

The classrooms probably haven't been renovated since the 1960s or so. The sidewalks and building steps are disentegrating. Technology is hardly ever functioning or updated.

                "Marie": "There are several different stereotypes about Howard and Howard students:\r\n1. People naturally assume Howard is a party school. To be honest the best time to party is in the fall during Howard University's Homecoming. It is most known for having many celebrities and faces among the Howard University crowd and a lot of people do come out to see what's going on at Homecoming. But after that, most student are actually studying, trying to get involved in political issues such as the Presidential Election 2008 or JENA 6 or volunteering to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\r\n2. Certain people think that if you go to Howard, you are definitely from the DMV (DC, MD, or VA) area. This is not true. Even though I am a DC native and a resident of the state of Maryland, I know more people who are from the Caribbean, New York, California and Texas. Most people who are residents of DC who walk on Howard's campus assume that everyone at Howard is from the DC-area.\r\n3. Some men believe that the women of Howard are stuck up, \"bougie\" or too fly to get with. As an intelligent woman, I have goals, dreams, and standards. No, I will not get with you if you are not my type (whatever I deem my type to be). But women are selective when it comes to men. If you are not an educated, opinionated man who sets goals and delivers, sure a woman may shut you guys down. But aren't you the same type of brothers that walk and step onto our campus to look at these \"fly, fine ass women\" that you and your boys drool over? Because we are a diverse campus with different types of styles from different places, you will meet many different types of women that represent every different thing under the sun. I would say we are beautiful, intelligent, and able women who are trying to lead successful lives as we plan for our futures.\r\n4. The Brown Paper Bag test and Light-skinned versus Dark-skinned complexions. Surely race is a number one factor in this country. People love to dismiss this but I don't. Everytime I fill out a government document that requires me to answer what is my ethnicity/racial group, I get frustrated when I check, type or answer Black/African-American. Don't get me wrong, this has helped me when I wanted to get into mostly Caucasian schools such as the University of Maryland, University of Southern California, and Immaculata University (thank you affirmative action and equal opportunity). But I chose Howard. When I walk onto Howard's campus, there is an immediate segregation among our Black sisters and brothers. Maybe. But this stereotype still holds some truth. When determining what organizations you want to join, whether community service, social clubs, state clubs, fraternities/sororities, student government, etc., should there be an exclusion to our different shades of brown? No. In a most recent Hilltop, Howard's daily collegiate publication, two very great writers commented about being black among a diverse population and the 20th Anniversary of Spike Lee's film \"School Daze\". I read both and was astounded but what both writers commented about: The division of African-Americans on campus due to our socioeconomic statuses and colorism. It got me thinking that as a student body of diverse cultures and different shades of brown, that we need to come together and eliminate the segregation among us.\r\n5. Howard University is like a fashion show; different styles among different groups of people trying to show off and shut down their peers with fashion-saavy attitudes. Well, not entirely true. Sure people do try to look their best as the walk across the yard to see their friends and gradually make it to their class by 12:10. Surely, I am one of them. I am not a deemed fashionista but I do sport my business attire (conservative or casual) faithfully around campus because I am a Business major. But this is what makes Howard special; there is lots of fashion and unique styles around Howard's campus that has everyone asking where'd you get this or how much did you pay for those boots? Surely, we are not rich but there are bargains for looking your "

Therefore they know exactly the right material to teach their students so that they are accurately prepared for the real world. I myself am a journalism major. My journalism professors are currently employed by different news outlets and occasionally call on students to help them with their professional assignments. Also, Howard teaches you the value of being persistent and hungry to learn - inside and outside the classroom. The hunger for success becomes a part of your character before you even realize it. That persistence and drive can never steer you wrong nowadays. Lastly, with Howard being located literally five minutes away from the heart of Washington, D.C., our nation's capital, students have a plethora of access and opportunities available to them. As a student, you have to make your college experience a memorable one. You can do the basics and attend class and return to your dorm, or you can utilize every minute of free time to expand your resume and become a vastly cultured and informed individual.

People will respect you as an individual thinker just because you are a product of this institution.  2.) Although Howard University is a wonderful place it definitely could use some changes.  The two main areas I would say need some work are the employees that work at Howard and the facilities.  When I say the employees, I am not referring to the professors, but the employees that work in the administration building, dorms, cafeteria, food court, security, etc. all need to be reconsidered.  Most of the people that work in these positions are DC natives and are very rude to the students and do not do their jobs efficiently.  If anything these jobs should be given to students as work study programs, or at least qualified individuals or professionals.    The facilities around campus are one thing that really needs help.  Most of the buildings look decent on the outside, but on the inside they are run down, lacking air conditioning, lacking proper equipment etc.   I think instead of spending so much money on unnecessary things during Homecoming, maybe they should renovate the buildings,  or upgrade some of the academic equipment. 3.)    As far as the size of Howard University, I feel like it is perfect.  I would not consider Howard a big school by any means, but it is still not very small either, Howard holds almost 11,000 students undergrad and graduate, making it the perfect size to where you feel like you\u2019re in college but not too many students, so each student feels like they get the attention they deserve.  4.)  The way people react to when I tell them I go to Howard depends greatly on the person.  If you tell a fellow African American they are very happy and supportive, and may show more support for me than Black students who go to predominantly White institutions.  When dealing with other races I\u2019ve found many have heard of Howard and respect it as a good source of higher education, and the handful I have encountered who have not heard of Howard respect it and me very much after I tell them about the school.  5.)  When on campus, most students will hang out on the big open area in the middle of the campus called \u201cThe Yard\u201d.  The yard is the perfect place for students to hangout, show off their outfits, and see all their friends.  The Yard is also a place where many of the big events take place including the Howard University Homecomings Yardfest.  When it is cold though, The Yard along with the rest of the campus is like a ghost town.  6.)  Unfortunately Howard does not have a traditional \u201ccollege town\u201d.  Howard is located in the heart of North West Washington DC, and the surrounding area is considered to be not very safe.  So majority of the things happen on and immediately around campus.  One good thing about Howard\u2019s location is that it is ten minutes away from downtown, U street, Adams Morgan, and various colleges and universities around DC such as American, George Washington, and Georgetown, making fun very easy to find on and around Howards campus.  7.)  The administration at Howard is terrible.  The employees are very unorganized and rude, they are not looking for the student\u2019s best interest, and they are just there to make a paycheck.  Administration is probably one of the biggest issues at Howard University; they lose stuff, don\u2019t call back or answer the phones, and also don\u2019t email students back.  8.)  Some controversy that Howard seems to face is the credibility of the education that an HBCU can provide.  The credibility of a degree from an HBCU is questioned frequently and Howard students always seem to prove the credibility.  Proving the credibility has been hard lately due to budget cuts, and Howard University almost closing down many different programs around campus.  9.)  Howard has a lot of school pride!  The pride is not seen in the same way as other universities through sports, but it is seen through different realms.  Howard marching band, dormitories, alumni, homecoming, dance teams (ooh la la\u2019s and bisonnettes), and academic organizations are all areas where the great HU school pride is seen.  10.)  I don\u2019t think there is anything \u201cunusual\u201d about Howard the only thing that is maybe untraditional is that the school is predominantly Black.  11.)  The largest complaints you will hear around Howard University\u2019s campus are complaints about the administration, facilities, unprofessional employees, and lack of urgency in the campus police.

                "Brianna": "The best thing is the family that you are welcomed to once you enroll in school. I really love it here. Because Howard is a Historically Black University, Number 2, to be exact, people really are here to help. Professors really want to see you do well and you are not just another number. The one thing I would change is the idea that everyone thinks they are elite and can sometimes treat others differently, if they do not seem to have the \"status\". The size is just right. People are excited when I tell them I go to Howard. We are smack dab in the middle of the city, with tons of things to do. The school's administration is working to get better. School pride is not like that of Duke, but it is great for an HBCU that is more focused on academics and successful careers. ",
                "Lisa": "Howard University really can't be done justice in the short paragraph I am about to write.  When I tell people that I attend Howard University, I always get a reaction of astonishment and awe because Howard is a very known and prestigious university.  There is a legacy attached to the name and as a student, you instantly feel that pride in your school and the obligation you have to continue the legacy.  The biggest downfall of Howard in the Administration.  You will always hear of the dreaded \"A building\" where financial aid is located on the second floor.  The DC area is also a very interesting place to live.  I personally came here from a surburb of Chicago, Illinois and it took a lot of adjusting.  Freshman year is great, take advantage of the easy classes you will take.  Greek life is intense so if you plan on pledging, be ready.  But overall, Howard is the REAL HU and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. :)",

                "Stephen": "The school is a good place to earn your undergraduate degree (cannot speak for medical, dental, or professional programs as I am not there yet). For the most part the professors are good and willing to help. Some classes are easy some are hard (much like at every other school). As well as there are so many activities and clubs to help with relaxation since college doesn't mean working on coursework every minute of everyday. Overall Howard is a university that is welcoming and a good fit for many differing personalities.",
                "Mariah": "First and foremost!  You must know about the 'A' Building before you come to HU so you can be mentally prepared for the run-around.  The 'A' Building can be your friend and it can be your worst enemy, from losing paperwork to getting a decent amount on your refund check.  I am sure every student at Howard, including faculty, has their share of stories about the 'A' Building and with that being said this does not reflect highly on Howard.  The education is excellent with the exception to a few professors who will irk your spirit but its mostly the atmosphere that we as students love. But then again every school most likely has its negatives and I cannot think of one person who has said they hate HU despite the dreadful visits to the 'A' building.  I love my school regardless.",
                "Jane ": "The school isn't going to spoon-feed you. If you want something you are going to have to fight for it. The university embeds ambition and hunger into its students. \r\n\r\nProfessionally, there are an abundance of resources and students are quite competitive. Resumes, portfolios and business cards will become essential by the end of the fall semester of your freshman year. \r\n\r\nSocially, there is always something going on. From house parties, to clubs, to bars, nightlife is always vibrant. There are also quite a few museums and cultural events happening on a regular basis. If you get tired of the city, Maryland & Virginia are only a short metro ride away. The Megabus also sponsors trips to cities such as Philly & New York for very low prices. \r\n\r\nAcademically, the professors are phenomenal. Most of the professors are still practicing in their fields, so they are up to date on their subject matter. The university constantly sponsors guest lectures from some of the most credible scholars in the world.",
                "Kiah": "Howard University is a place where you'll really figure out who you are. There are amazing things about the school that you will only experience at an HBCU. For example, speakers from all over the world and from all different career backgrounds come to speak to our students. We have a lot of events and opportunities to get involved on and off campus. We have the best Homecoming that is talked about in songs and that people travel from across the country to attend. The cultural experience here is one that can't be measured. \r\n\r\nHowever, you will constantly here complaints about the Administration \"A\" Building. The customer service ca sometimes not be up to par and you sometimes end up fighting for your financial aid. You learn to work hard for what you want. You learn to fight for what you believe in. It's a taste of the real world all in one campus.",
                "Nia": "Overall, Howard is a wonderful institution that produces ambitious, entrepreneurial leaders. It is highly recognized in the global community and attending school in a thriving cultural city such as DC is a one-of-a-kind experience. \r\n\r\n Through different organizations, social activities and classes students here learn a lot of life lessons and how to stand out in the crowd. Howard definitely has its adverse aspects, such as difficult service in the administration building, financial aid woes and challenging professors but they are all what make my school's experience unique. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing like Howard's Homecoming which has become famous and networking at this school is unbelievable. With alumni like Taraji P. Henson, Phylicia Rashad, Bianca Chardei and multiple others, and students such as \"Afro Blue\" from the sing-off it is evident the amount of talent that enters and leaves this institution. \r\n\r\n Howard is truly a family. You come on your own freshman year but leave with networks, new friends and a second family. ",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "Howard University is a great place to have the ability to network and find people who are just as passionate about what you want to do. The one thing I love about this school is all doors are open to endless possibilities and the environment is situated in a way where the sky is the limit. Being located in Washington, DC, all opportunities from being on capitol hill, to being the next best actor or actress, to the next big entrepreneur are open in the nations capitol. The area is changing a lot, and it is a progressive town for those that are willing to work for success. The only downside to the university is the Administration may not be the easiest to work with, but its a part of the Howard experience and working with our administration prepares to deal with anything in life.

                "Torry": "BEWARE!!\nInsularity and nepotism are rampant. There are other schools which will educate you better. No need to suffer the horror of an effete institution.",
                "Jesse": "Howard has a rich legacy and great historical significance to the African-American community.  There is a significant amount of school pride. It's central DC location offers many off campus opportunities and internships. Also, the DC university consortium is excellent. If a student chooses, they can take courses at Georgetown, GWU, Catholic University, GMU, Corcoran, and other educational institutions in the DC area and receive credit. Research opportunities are phenomenal when you consider this added with being in the same city as Library of Congress. The administration is absolutely terrible. They are routinely disrespectful and unorganized. I was in the college of arts and sciences and my academic counselor was the worst. If you need to get any administrative issues handled, you are resigned to wild goose chases and lines that last forever, especially your first year.\nWith that said, the best thing about Howard was its inspiring faculty and the sense of camaraderie and intellectual respect amongst the student body.",
                "Logan": "The experience I've gotten from Howard has been inspiring yet disappointing. As a black male,  realize what an achievement it is for me simply to strive for a higher education. It's inspiring to see thousands of people who look like you trying to elevate their condition and the condition of the Black community. It's almost a spiritual experience to attend Howard in that you learn more about who you are, more about who you are as a Black person, and more about your history. Howard homecoming, speakers, and other events have led me to say \"this is why I decided to go to an HBCU.\"\n\nOn the other hand, a large segment of Howard students perpetuate Black stereotypes. I've heard some opinions expressed in classes which have no factual basis and are pretty ignorant and uninformed. I know plenty of guys who are at Howard simply to \"tap the plentiful a**\" available. And plenty of the women go along with it which is a shame. Howard is not nearly as impressive as many claim. It isn't a great school, but it is a good school.",
                "Alex": "I believe that the most frequent student complaints are based on some type of administration problem. Either it is not being validated and therefore having to fight to find out why and fix it, or it is not having housing after only your freshman year. The housing is a very big issue, because they claim to not have enough housing for everyone. Many people end up moving off-campus after their freshman year.",
                "Bobby": "It is said that Howard University can't really be explained. It something you have to truly experience. Only a bison knows how anohter bison feels about the school. Howard University is a like a family member that may get on your nerves every once in a while but you still love them to death. At Howard there is never a dull moment with all the programs that are provided every night and the great Washington Dc surround our campus. Everyone on the campus is like your family and it truly provides a family atmosphere. I know I speak for almost everyone when I say we love our Howard U.",
                "Emmerson": "Communication definitely rules the nation. The greatest thing about Howard it the networking!! You never know who you might meet or who you're speaking with, but it's always a good thing for everyone you meet to know your name. The main issue that desperately needs to be addressed is the administration and the attitudes that comes along with it. If I could change one thing that would definitely be it. When it comes to the admintstation the students don't feel secure with them handling their money, nor any other important matters. And because of the staffs awful attitudes, students are too intimidated to go and address their issues. This needs to change!! Every year Howard accepts more students than they can house. This leaves students feeling lost and helpless. So, obviously our school is just a tad bit too small. When I tell people that I attend Howard University the biggest smile spreads accross their faces, for they know that I am destined for great things!! Because of my major, English, I spend most of my time in class or in my dorm, writing. The most recent controversy that people are still dealing with is the housing issue. As of right now, I still have no place to stay next year!! Despite the many issues students are faced with on a daily basis, everyone will tell you there is no place like Howard!! We've got Bison pride...yes we do!!! Strangely, there is nothing unusual about Howard. Howard is second to none, so even the unusual is considered to be the norm. The experience that I'll remember the most is the Jena 6 rally. It was amazing to see so many students in my age bracket come together and willing to make a change and take a stand. \"Ugh, I hate the 'A'(administration)building,\" is the number one complaint of Howard University's students....CONGRATULATIONS!!",
                "Alicia": "The best thing about Howard is the overall experience, which is difficult to put into words. Although the school does have a lot of flaws, that all adds to the \"Howard Experience\". The school seems big, but it's actually pretty small. You'll feel like you're in high school all over again with the cliques, gossip, etc. But it's easy to get acquainted with. It depends on who you're telling, but for the most part people have very positive reactions when you tell them that you go to Howard, and it does remind you that the name holds alot of weight. On campus, there's not too many places to hang out, but DC is definitely a fun town, not exactly a \"college town\" because there's so much other stuff going on, but there are certain places(restaraunts, bars, clubs) that Howard students frequent. The Administration SUCKS(what else is new). They put the majority of the Howard population through Hell, but we all accept it. There's always some sort of controversy on campus, recently the biggest was probably our President's retirement/resignation. There's a lot of school pride, but don't confuse that with school spirit, which we definitely lack, especially as far as supporting our sports teams is concerned. Being at Howard is an amazing experience, for better or for worse.",
                "robYn": "The best thing about Howard it the poeple.  The school is not is not too small I feel its just right and the only thing I would change is the administration.  I would also chang the visitation rules for the dorms.  There is so much school pride and people think very highly of you when you tell them you go to Howard.",
                "Denise": "The best thing about Howard is the price.  We have a great name and some great professors who make sure we get the most for our money.  I would change the dorms because there are too many students that cannot get housing.   Additionally, visitation rules need to change.  It is great to know they are concerned with our safety, their rules are too restrictive.",
                "Reese": "The best thing about Howard is the student body. Howard has a very diverse student body. Washington, DC has a lot to do with that, seeing as though it to has a very diverse population. You'll meet students from a wide variety of countries, cultures, upbringings, and beliefs. Howard is also known for its \"recreational\" activities. Howard's homecoming is legendary and largely attended by more than just locals and alumnae. Celebrities often make it a point to be present at the homecoming events. However Howard has its issues. One of my  major issues with Howard is their inconsistency when it comes to procedure and policy. It is common for you to receive several contradicting suggestions or comments with the same department. Many of the administrative offices will send you on a treasure hunt to complete simple tasks like receiving your financial aid refund, paying your Howard balance, applying for emergency loans, etc. It can be quite annoying and discouraging. Howard is also known for losing documents after a crucial deadline has passed, forcing you to have to resubmit your information \"late.\" Because of these issues, I have learned to make copies of everything I give Howard; I take down the names of every individual I speak to and the date I spoke to that person as well; I am also forced to harass them with phone calls to assure that any documents requested of me have been received, processed, and logged into my personal account. Howard teaches how to be cautious and meticulous. These are amongst the most complaints I hear on a daily basis at Howard. Another issue the students have is the subpar conditions a lot of our facilities are in. We are currently renovating several buildings but it makes no sense for the majority of the main campus to have so many physical problems. Some buildings lack functioning heaters and air conditioners; some don't have enough desks. The dorms also could use a lot of remodeling. Some dorms are older than others and lack amenities like air conditioning; even some of the newer dorms are infested with roaches and sometimes mice, one of our dorms have extremely sensitive sprinklers which causes problems, and our freshman dorms have smoke detectors with the nose of Superman and are guaranteed to go off and force us all outside at no specific time at least once every two weeks. The food is overprocessed and served on sometimes dirty dishes that I am forced to sift through for the least dirty of them all to then rinse under the hot water spout supposed to be used for tea. I could go on and on about my issues with Howard's campus, dormitories, and lack of fresh foods. \r\n\r\nWith all that said however, Howard offers you an experience second to none. I used to consider my feelings about Howard similar to those of a woman unable to leave an abusive relationship; he hits me but I love him and I know he loves me. I was wrong. My relationship with Howard has been most similar to that of a family. There is this unconditional love between me and Howard. We will always fight and we will constantly fail to see eye to eye. But I would never trade my family for anything in the world. Howard is one of a kind. Not only will you have the time of your life enjoying the new friends you make from places you've never been or even heard of; you will also be bombarded with opportunities to advance in any field you may be interested; and most importantly you will become a part of as expanding network of the best and brightest of America. Howard is not for the weak, or the unsure, it is for the determined and motivated who will contribute to its rich legacy. \r\n\r\nThe Real HU!! Bison for life.\r\n\r\nMs. Wright",
                "Bevan": "The best thing about Howard is its students. The mix of black people from every socioeconomic level, religion, culture and background is unlike anything I ever could have gotten from a majority school. My experiences with the student body and extracurriculars are what make me inevitably say that I like Howard when my thoughts on the way the school is run make me hesitate at first.\r\n\r\nI went to predominantly white schools all my life, so none of my friends had heard of Howard (an HBCU) when I announced I was going there during my senior year of high school. However, the school has a great legacy and name recognition in the professional world, which certainly doesn't hurt.\r\n\r\nThe main cmapus is one of the smallest I've ever seen, and I like that with only about 10,000 undergrads, there probably six (or fewer) degrees of separation between everyone.\r\n\r\nI love that I'm in D.C. and that there are so many interesting things about it, but I do sometimes feel like I missed out by not living in a typical \"college town.\"\r\n\r\nWe certainly have a lot of school pride, as evidenced by our alumni. However, there's not much hype around athletics because the our teams for typically popular sports (basketball, football, etc.) aren't that great. But our homecoming is always a huge event, attracting celebrities, alumni and even people who never went here from across the country.",
                "Carson": "The best thing about Howard is its legacy. And even though many people say that it's true because after you graduate with a degree from Howard u would need to find a job, a job will find you -granted that you had good grades and all that. \r\nOne thing that I would change about Howard the administration. Many things about it is rly bad and hopefully with an incoming new president, things will get better. \r\nThe size is just right.\r\nThe way people react when I tell them I go to Howard depends on where that person comes from. Usually, if they're from the area they are very familiar with Howard and therefore arent very impressed, but if I tell someone is from farther away or is just ignorant to all of Howard secrets, they are very excited.\r\nOn campus, I spend most of my time in my room.\r\nThere is definately no \"college town\" around Howard. But a few businesses that share the same street with our university give discounts to us, or just simply have a Howard flag or something.\r\nHoward admin sucks.\r\nWell there was a protest to shut down the engineering builing.\r\nDEFINATELY!!! Howard's school pride is infectious.\r\nOne thing that's unsual is the extreamly poor condition of some of the buildings. The biology building for examaple has electric wires and all sorts of dangerous things hanging from the ceiling and class still goes on in there. I think thats very unusual for a college campus. I mean we pay tuition to fix these sort of things. Also, Howard is kind of like a cult.\r\nThe jazz fest. It was amazing.\r\nThe adminsitration, the food sucks, the \"locals\"",
                "Dominique": "a) The best thing about Howard is the experience. Each person that sets foot on campus will have one, both good and bad. From the friends one can acquire to the social experience to the realization that you attend a university full of history, it is all quite inspiring and even heartwarming(not to be cheesy). b)If I could change anything, I would enhance the level of difficulty of the coursework where it is needed. c) For me, the campus is just right. 11,000 students(6,500 of which are undergrad). I couldn't see myself at a smaller school or a larger school. d)Well, it depends on who you tell. If you tell fellow African Americans that you attend HU, some are impressed. If you tell some corporate figures, they may be impressed, that depends on their company's experience. If you tell an everyday Caucasian, they may 1) look at you in amazement as they initially think you say Harvard or 2) look at you in a dumbfound way as they have NO CLUE what or where HU is. e) As a business student, most of my time was spent in the School of Business or in my dorm, by preference and workload. For the other students, \"The Yard\" IS the chill spot. \r\nf)You could say \"college town\" because once you hit Howard territory, you KNOW you're on campus and the radio stations are abreast of Howard events etc. Other \"competitors\" could be considered Georgetown, American, etc...g)THE ADMINISTRATION SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE IT!!!!! I'm sure my peers can confirm this sentiment from 1989 to the present. (In 1989, the students protested, as they stood in front of the Administration building in large numbers until their needs were met. Historical moment and unfortunately, still needed to this day. (SAD FACE) h)Biggest recent controversy is difficult. Not to say we had plenty, but that question again is subject to one's interpretation. We receiving a new University President for the 2009 year and their selection is pivotal, but aside from that, I really couldn't tell you. i)I would say there IS a lot of school pride, but not athletically which is where it would mostly show. We don't have the best sports teams. Some are good, but they are few in numbers. j)I don't believe there is anything unusual about Howard besides the fact that it is a great institution(again, not unusual). Period. j)I'll never forget the relationships I established with my dorm floor(yes, the whole floor) freshman year. [NOTE TO FRESHMAN GIRLS: For the full dorm experience, you MUST, I repeat, YOU MUST stay in \"The QUAD\". It will do you an injustice if you don't]. We had extra dorm and floor spirit. During a dorm ceremony, we walked outside with a chant and a hand signal(NO GANG STUFF) which made the other girls follow suit. We were remembered for all we did that year i.e. getting in trouble from time to time as a floor(it was soooo much fun) having our own fashion show on the floor, creating our own runway with the drawers under our beds, dressing up the girls, and opening it to all other students and doing our chant at the Homecoming game that year. We were extra proud and truly enjoyed ourselves.(One of the greatest experiences of my life) k) the most frequent student complaints come from the Administration Building, as unqualified, non-professional employees treat the students horribly in our time of need."

This means that you have to be aware of your surroundings at all times and sometimes a little paranoria is a good thing. When you are adjusting to a new school and environment, there will always be people who are willing to help you get adjusted. Whenever you have questions, do not be afraid to ask someone because not asking might cause you to remain confused for a while. This holds true for your academic experience as well. If you ever have questions about anything in your classes, do not hesistate to discuss the matter with them. The professors will not know how they can help you if you do not get to know them.

Venture out of your comfort zone and explre your surroundings.",
                "John": "It's important to understand how to select a school based on your future career goals as opposed to choosing a school specifically for the \"college life.\" Don't break the bank on student loans just so that you can immerse yourself in a dynamic social atmosphere. Higher educiation is about learning, as opposed to partying. If you're unable to afford the high cost of tuition that accompanies most universities, especially in regard to out-of-state schools, attend a local junior college. Attending a JC for two years might not seem like an ideal scenario, but it will allow you to grow up a bit while also completing all of your lower division credits. Most importantly, it'll help prevent you from acquiring the obtrusive burden of crippling student loan debt. Be active in your community as you prepare to apply for schools and seek out scholarship opportunities. Also, be sure to fill out an annual FAFSA so that you can gain access to potential state and government educational grants. Following these tips won't be easy; life happens. But you'll be on your way to a successful college career if you're able to do so.",
                "Daniel": "If I could go back in time and redo college life, knowing the different things that I know now, I would have done the following:\n\nWhen I graduated high school, I did not have a good foundation in basic math and english.  Because of that, I had to start from the bottom and take the beginners college classes as prerequisites to the regular college level classes and it delayed the process for my college career.  Had I known,  I would have taken the extra math and english courses during my HS senior year, so that way I would have been up to the correct grade level in college.\n\nWhen I started college, I did not know what I wanted to do with my life.  It took me some time to figure out which direction I wanted to head in and I also took some extra classes that I did not need for my current master's degree.  Looking back, I realized that it may have been beneficial if I would have volunteered my summer time during my high school years in the different job areas, in order to get a taste of what career I would want to pursue in.",

Seeing firsthand how alarmingly high  stress levels are rising amidst  high school students, I can only wish that someone was able to pull me aside and calm me down, reminding me that while the acceptance rate at Yale is 4%, there are a multitude of other institutions in which I would blossom. And I would be sure to mention that college should not be stressful, and while there are certainly late nights and midnight coffee runs, college is fun because it is about exploration. It is about taking advantage of the much wider array of organizations and classes and people that each campus has to offer. As teenagers, we grow and change and stretch our minds past what we can imagine  at 18, only if we remind ourselves to never let stress overwhelm our experience. I wish I could go back in time and remind myself to relax, so stress did not overwhelm my senior experience.",

College is sooooo much different from high school, therefore there is so much advancing and progression that needs to take place within myself and my habits.  You can procrastinate, but it is not recommended whatsoever.  There is no such thing as free time. Not to say that you'll be buried in books and homework, but thus there is so much to be apart of and to do on campus aside from your school work, you'll always remain busy.  When you're not doing anything, you should be studying.  No one is here to push you, because you are no one's true concern.  You must put aside the immature things you did as an adolescent in high school and become an adult in college.  Though you are a first-time student in college and have time and room for curiousity and mistakes, you can easily avoid many expected mistakes by preapring yourself now.

I always felt like I had something to prove, but I didn't know what. The first piece of advice I would give myself is to look in the mirror, smile at myself and say \"You are enough. You are going to succeed. Your passion shows. It is okay to not be what people consider perfect because you did your best and that is always the best you could do.\" I would still advise myself to give it all that I have, but I would warn myself to be easier on me and to give myself a break sometimes.

Find someone (a professor, advisor, classmate, etc) on campus that has similar career goals such as yourself. Complete all work on time and never slack. Remember why you came to college: to graduate and receive a degree. Sure the social life seems fun, but make sure that you have a balance. Commit yourself to studying at least 10 hours per week.

Now knowing what I know about college life and making the transition I would have spent less time worrying about my social life and dorm rooms and focus more the important things such as the opportunities that the university offer and finding a college where I was sure I could flourish academically and professionally.

Time management is something that you hear about all the time as a high school senior but when you are actually on campus it is a completely different world. The problem with my personal experience was that there was no transition from high school to college; I did not change my study habits, therefore my grades suffered ridiculously. I went from leaving high school with a 3.5 to receiving grades that I'm ashamed to even speak of. This has hindered so many aspects of my college life, and I had to spend the following semesters catching up just to be able to qualify for scholarships. It was a struggle academically, socially, financially and personally, and I believe that it could have all been easily avoided had I known how to balance things like I do now.

By this time you are a senior in high school, and things are beginning to distract you from what\u2019s really important. I\u2019m about to warn you that your laziness this year will truly effect our success and any scholarships we may have qualified for in the future.

I know you sometimes feel inadequate, but as your future self, trust me when I say you have all that you need to be successful in this world. Do not be afraid to apply to any and every university that you are even remotely interested in. Also remember that money does matter. You do not want to worry about how you're going to pay tuition each year, so choose a school that offers you lots of scholarships and grants.  Lastly, take the time find what you're passionate about, it makes choosing a major much easier and will save you the hassel of taking classes that you are not interested in.

I started college thinking that I am not going to party and focus solely on my schoolwork. Schoolwork is important but college is also about the people you meet, and the memories you create with those people. It took me a long time to transition and my freshman year passed me bye.

Once you go to college, everything you do is preparing you to be competitive in a struggling job market; your future depends on it. Learn to network, find your voice because college will teach you that it's not always what you know, but who you know. Polish your communication skills and character because that, alone, can open so many doors for you. Realize your potential, and what you can offer the world, and manifest it. Be an individual and understand that every decision you make will only help or hinder you; don't always follow the crowd becuase they could all be wrong. Be active on campus, work aggressively, and,  most importantly, go to class.

Now by changing you I don't mean change the core of who you are. What I'm simply suggesting is that sometimes we have to reevaluate some of our ways, thoughts, and actions in order to adapt to a new environment. Transitioning from high school to college was a hard time for me because I was moving to a completely new place I had never even visited and left all of my friends and family behind. I was always a quiet, shy person but somehow I managed to make friends in high school. However, college was a totally new dynamic and quite frankly very intimidating. The fact that it took me a very long time to break out of my shell and comfort zone hindered my college experience. So that's my advice: DON'T BE YOURSELF!",

After graduation my friends and I all went our separate ways and it was hard adjusting to not seeing them every moment of the day. It didn't dawn on me until later on in my freshmen year that i needed to reminisce on our memories to get me through the next chapter in my life. The next thing i would tell my senior self is to apply for endless scholarships. Paying for college is not easy, and it doesn't hit you until your actually in college adding up all the expenses. There are a lot of people out here willing to invest in students futures you just have to search them out. The last thing i would say is to think of college and graduating as a fresh start to a new world and to approach it with a big mind and open heart!",
                "Amirah": "I would tell myself to get on the computer and immediately start researching scholarships and looking more in depth into the universities on my list about their administration and financial aid processes. I made the mistake of making my bed too early thinking that a high GPA, challenging course load and an acceptable resume would fill out all scholarship applications for me. I also made the mistake of not double checking with the college of my choice on how they handled financial aid and freshman scholarship incentives, which resulted in a huge financial set back many months later, forcing me to leave in the middle of my first freshman semester with no records. It left me only able to work until I could save up enough money and head back to square one all over again as a freshman a year later. I would tell myself that where you are happy and feel that you are meant to be is where you will thrive and knowing takes experiences, good and bad. Lastly, I would say tuition is not cheap, so take all the knowledge and advice you can from your professors and anyone inspiring you meet along the way.",

You have stay focus and remember that you are there to learn and graduate.  That your future depends on what you do for these 4 to 5 years.  Never lose sight of your goals.\n\n2)  If you need help do not be afraid or to proud to ask for it.  At school there are professors and advisors that are willing to help you with anything, you just have to ask.  \" A closed mouth does not get fed\"  a quote that mom told that I have put into practice a lot since I left for school.   \n\n3)  College is supposed to be the best time of your life.  You are finding yourself, becoming idependent and learning with others who want the same thing as you.  To be successful.  School will have its moments when it will be very challenging, just take a breath, relax  and know that you are making something of yourself.  Be happy about it.",

You may get tired of the food. You may never want to get up for that 8:10 class. You may have too much pride to ask your professor for help. You may want to skip that club meeting. However, you will do all that you can do to showcase your intelligence, campus/community involvement, and most of all YOU. Stay true to yourself. Study even if it means you lose hours of sleep. Do not procrastinate. It will stress you out. Be an internal push for yourself. Showcase the wonderful person that will be cultivating on the grounds of your university.

If I had the opportunity to talk to myself as a high school senior I would tell myself to start learning time management early. I've learned that time management is essential. as a college student. Not managing my time efficiently is one of the leading causes of stress for me as a college student. I would also tell myself to prioritize and to develop a time schedule to better help priortize my days. Moreover, I would tell myself not to spread myself too thin.

Be involved in an activity at school whether that is music, sports, drama or something else. It is good for you socially and mentally and you may be eligible for more scholarships. Apply for schoalrships starting your junior year. There are a ton of them out there and it is to your advantage to look for them. Look at the differences between a 2 year and 4 year college. Take a career interests survey or test if you are not sure what you want to do. Overall, be studious and resourceful. You never know what opportunities you may have if you don't look for them.

However, I only learned what I felt I needed to know for my test, or crammed information I wasnt really interested in, so that I could do well on the test. With that being the case, I only remember the information for the test, and I would forget the information afterwards. From college, I have been able to realize that it is nothing but a deeper recap or advancement of what you have already learned in highschool. If I could do it all over, I would defeinitely find and interst in the information I learned in my highschool classes and use it to make me abetter, less stressed college student. It would all be a recap instead of a deep study.",

First thing i'd tell myself if to be fearless,not every move needs to be carefully calculated because many opportunities are missed when one obsesses over waiting for the perfect time/circumstances. The second thing I'd tell myself is that the only person responsible for my education and life is ME. It is my responsibility to ask questions,ask for guidance,go out and get those scholarships and to wake up early in the morning and go to class motivated every day. Third I'd tell myself is to don't be afraid of failing. The greatest life experiences comes from \"failing\",having the resilience to persevere with confidence is where lies your tools for growth. I call those blessings in disguise and when you are able to look back and see your growth is when you'll experience maturity blossoming like a flower.

I took sophomore level courses to try and get ahead in my degree and it turned out that I wasn\u2019t near ready enough. I had taken the easy way out in high school. I was the typical jock who thought that being a football player in high school would carry me all the way through schooling. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Taking the easy classes in high school didn\u2019t help me prepare for college one bit. If I could write a letter to myself in high school I would force myself to take AP classes. As hard as they seem at the time they pay off so much more in helping students prepare for college.",

I passed all of my high school classes, but i did not complete them to my highest potential. If i knew then what i know now, i would tell myself that taking the short cut and slacking is not the answer because in college if you follow that same path, you dont acquire the college level skill of learning, therefore being detrimental to your grade.  Studying, taking notes, brain storming, outlining, and reading are things that i didnt usually take the time to do in high school, and when i entered my first semester in college it was a culture shock to me seeing alot of other students constantly doing that for lectures, tests and essay prepping. Being in my 4th semester of college i have adapted to those skills which have helped me essentially become a better student. If i would have done any of those things in high school, then i would have done alot better than i did. I should have prioritized better in high school.",

It is important that you take this opportunity to continue your education so that you can provide a better future for yourself and your family. Don't let your college experience be like the ones you had in high school. No longer should you wait til the last minute to do an assignment because procrastination is not an option for the level of success you are trying to achieve. Never choose a social life over your grades because every minute you spend studying counts. Most importantly, always remember who you are and what you stand for.

There are many opportunites that are offered to college students, but they are not handed to you, go out and get them.

There are couples far and few between, there are just too many options for guys and I honestly think many of them can't handle it.

First off, Howard is very unique, because it is a place of higher learning that is comprised of over 85 percent Black people.  Being at a university where you are surrounded by outstanding, well educated Black individuals makes the campus one of a kind.  Howard is also unique when it comes to the overall experience of the university.  On Howard\u2019s campus you will encounter a wide range of individuals, who are talented in all areas of the political, social, and media world, making the campus a very exciting and surprising place to be.  The campus has a new protest, concert, play, dance competition, fundraiser, community event every week, and it is safe to say there is never a dull moment on Howard\u2019s campus.  There are many traditional and untraditional traditions on Howard\u2019s campus.  Some of the traditional traditions include Howard University Homecoming, and it\u2019s annual events (Fashion Show, Step Show, Yardfest etc.), ResFest(spring competition between school dorms), Commencement, and many more.  Some of the untraditional traditions are traditions that are among the students, such as the first day of spring where all the students go and hang out on the yard all day, and university wide snowball fights on the first snowfall of winter.  To put it as simply as I possibly can, the reason I feel Howard stands out is because it is a rare university full of brilliant African Americans who can have fun, and celebrate their Black culture, but at the same time the students are intelligent and working to better the community and Black community.",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "The best thing about Howard is the student body. The students truly make the University. We are an international university with people coming on visa's from Africa, the Caribbean, and I even had two students in my class this year from Europe. Everyone here embraces the uniqueness that everyone else brings to this campus and we make the best out of it. We have so many different organizations that showcase different talents in so many different ways its hard to keep up with it. Even at the radio station, we have to keep our programming diverse because we don't have a typical listener or a standard student body. There is no one place in the world that is like Howard, its something that you just have to experience to truly understand how unique it is. ",

The area around Howard is a little complex, the immediate surroundings of Howard is not the best, Howard is honestly located in the \u201cghetto\u201d, and the surrounding area is not the safest place in the world.  It is very important to try and not walk around the surrounding areas of the campus by yourself especially at night.  When Howard students step off campus they generally become targets for the local residents to rob or harass.  The reason I said Howard\u2019s surrounding area is complex, is because the immediate streets around Howard are not the safest areas, and are considered to be lower class, and even ghetto, but two or three blocks off of the campus are great areas of DC.  DC is a city where you can be in a really dangerous area one minute then walk about fifty feet and be in a really nice upper class area.  When walking near campus the area is very dangerous and there isn\u2019t very much besides a McDonalds, liquor stores, and rundown buildings, but if you walk two blocks away you are on U Street, which has nice houses, bars, restaurants, art galleries etc.  Also if you go near dorms such as Meridian, and Slowe Hall, you will find nice classic DC style houses, and great shopping areas in Columbia Heights.  So when stepping off of Howards campus you will find it to not be the most pleasant area, but if you take the proper precautions, and get outside of the immediate area you will find great places to hangout safely (but keep in mind there are also other dangerous parts of DC away from Howard).

At certain points on campus, you can see a man made reservoir, you can see the capitol from some spots, you can see the Washington monument, you can see someone else's house that may not go to Howard, you can see a homeless person on your way to the metro, you can see life. Howard may help you, but does not shelter you; here are the mecca, the whole world is yours to see everything from the prettiest buildings, to reality.

If you are the type of person that you know you like to socialize, sometimes its best to pack up your stuff, head over to a startbucks or Bus Boys and Poets and 14th and U street, and do some independent studying. Studying is really important, because no one on this campus is going to spoon feed you an education. Sure you can pass all of your classes without buying a book, but if you think the $32,000 you, your parents, or sponsoring organization paid for is worth \"just getting by\", maybe considering a two year institution before coming to Howard may be best for you.

But honestly, its all about the school of business. I applied to UCONN, UMD, CCSU, and Howard. I got into all of them, scholarships from 3 and the one I didn't get a scholarship to, I went to. I fell in love with 21 CAP program because waiting until my junior year to start my major was  not an option for me. Ironically, I ended up falling in love with radio and spend the majority of my time in the School of Communications, but I still never changed my major. The culture and environment here is very open and inviting,  and it just felt right. This is a family environment and everyone has there place to fit it. Its just a cool place to be. ",

                "Drew": "    The common stereotypes for Howard students are that we are stuck up, very fashionable, and exclusive. I have not met an alumni who has not been proud of their attendance at Howard. Most people rep Howard for life, and I know this first hand because my grandparents, most of my aunts and uncles, my mother and her friends, and other friends/relatives have attended Howard. When I got accepted, many of my African American coworkers and peers were really supportive and \"wowed\" that I got in. Bison pride never dies. \r\n    Moreover, if you were to walk through campus during the week, you will see women and men dressed up just to go to class. Not everyone does this, but it is not uncommon. Women will wear heels, jewelry, skirts, dresses, etc, the latest fashion is always exemplified on campus. What surprised me the most was the men wearing bow ties, polos, nice shoes, and looking very clean cut. I kind of like how the fashion culture keeps me from wearing sweats and pjs to class. I'm almost never wearing the latest trends, but I definitely spend some time on looking good (except on days when I don't go anywhere). It keeps me from getting too lazy, and who doesn't want to look good?\r\n    Finally, Howard is very exclusive. It is so easy to get caught up in the Howard life and not explore DC at all. Howard has so much diversity, many activities/organizations, and culture that people may deem is unnecessary to go anywhere else. However, I recommend expanding your horizon and getting into the DC life as well. There is so much out there that will complement your Howard life. It's as simple as getting on the metro. Don't wait for your friends to finally get around to going places besides the club; going places by yourself sets you up for meeting others easily. That means more contacts and networking down the road...\r\n",

The way I see it is this - in the real world there are many different types of people. There are people who expect others to worship the ground they walk on, and there are people that realize they have to work for everything in life. While there may be a few stuck up people at Howard, the majority of students are not like that.",

                "Darrian": "Howard University and its students harbor various stereotypes.  The most known stereotype of Howard is the idea that it is the \u201cBlack\u201d version of Harvard University.  Howard University is full of scholars, intellectual thinkers, and activist, giving it the reputation of having some of the most intelligent Black people in the nation.  Most students at Howard take their education extremely serious, and many times having the best grades, internships, honors, or being in the most organizations becomes a sort of competition between students around campus.  At Howard people don\u2019t necessarily praise the athletes or jocks, the intellectuals seem to get the most praise around Howard University\u2019s campus.  Although Howard students pride themselves on getting a good education it is true that Howard is a big party school (perfect example, Howard University Homecoming).  It is very rare that you can walk around campus and not hear music or see people dancing.  When it is warm in DC, the middle of the campus called \u201cThe Yard\u201d is full of students and loud music.  Howard is also known as a fashion school, students take pride in the way they dress.  Howard represents students from all over the nation and even outside of the country, so the school shows many different styles and fashions, making the student very critical of what themselves and others are wearing.  At Howard students are not afraid to break the norm when it comes to fashion, and it is not strange to see a female walking up a hill on campus for an 8am class in six inch heels.  The last stereotype Howard students have is that we are stuck up and think we are better than other Blacks.  This stereotype is one that is very absurd, many Howard students do represent the middle class Black, but each student is just there to get an education, have fun, and give back to the Black community.  ",
                "Brianna": "Howard is known as the Black Harvard. We have a lot of scholars at the university. Most students take their education very seriously and are on scholarships. Howard is known for Greek life as well as a top school for performing arts in the African American community. We know how to party, but are known to be cool kids because every state and several countries are represented. Howard is very diverse. ",
                "Lisa": "Students at Howard are often stereotyped as just going through the motions and no one here is really educated or receiving a quality education.  Also, because our school is predominantly African American, every student is perceived as the same.

                "Stephen": "A stereotype is that there is a \"dress code\" classified as the Howard girl look. This stereotype comes from the way some girls at Howard dress (heels, top of the line clothes, makeup, nails fancy hair styles, etc.) but it is not fully accurate as not all girls dress like that as well as its not required for you to dress like that.

                "Mariah": "When most people think of Howard University they think, \"Oh their parents must be rich to afford that school\".  In some cases, this is a true statement, but not all of us have that luxury;  we also work for our education.  You do have the few people that are stuck up and strictly come to school to put on a fashion show and flaunt all the new Apple Products, designer bags and blah blah blah but for the most part that is just a typical day on the yard.  You will see several fashionable people and you will see several fashionless people (if we can even call that a word) and this is coming from a Fashion Merchandising major. Uhm yes! there are a good amount of stuck up rich kids, there are a lot of stuck up people in general but you can find them anywhere, especially living in DC.  Other than the fact that we are the real HU, we are your typical everyday college that I have grown to LOVE!",

They more than likely were members of Jack & Jill. Many of their parents are successful businessmen, politicians, entertainers and philanthropists. They take fashion relatively seriously compared to your average state school.\r\n\r\nAlthough all of the above is true it doesn't represent the essence of Howard University.  Being that Howard is a private institution located in the middle of the Nation's Capital, the student population is very diverse. People often ask how can the university be diverse when the school is an HBCU. Geographically, ethnically, culturally and academically, the students vary. We all look, talk, and dress differently. ",

From her experience and from the reputation of Howard, a lot of people who graduate from the school look down on other people. While I will say some students leave with a feeling of superiority, the majority of us do not. We work hard while we're here and you learn a lot that prepares you for the real world. \r\n\r\nYou will also find that most people tend to join groups that are closely related to their career interests.

The stereotypes of a lot of Howard Students are uppity, smart, privileged African-American students. This couldn't be any further from the truth. A lot of students at Howard are on scholarship and have worked for their spot at the university. I believe another stereotype as well is the belief that all the students have great want to pledge. As Howard houses numerous Alpha Chapters of Sororities and frats, not every student at Howard wants to pledge or even be very socially active. ",

While this is not a negative stereotype, I believe the quality of education that is received depends upon the effort each student puts in. It is what you make of if. ",
                "Lauren-Nikai": "One of the largest stereotypes of Howard University is that is is known as the black version of Harvard University. Howard is a well accredited historically black university which prides its findings on the higher education of students. Our school of business is AACSB standards which is the same accreditation  as Cornell, Stanford, and Yale. (Harvard recently changed their accreditation standards to fit a different format). In addition, our school of business allows students to have hands on experience in the business world starting freshman year with the 21st century advantage program where freshman work with fortune 500 companies including Google, Verizon, Bank of America, and Deloitte. Most students at the university pride on academic success and happen to be of Black or African-American decent, so in regards to being \"the Black Harvard\" the stereotype is accepted. "

The professor asked me if a white man and a black man were drowning who would I save. I replied to him whoever was closest, to which he immediately responded equal distance. Again evading a direct answer I say I'll save the man struggling more, with the same speed he tells me, equal struggle. I tell him it's an unfair question and I do not want to answer.\r\n    At this point he had been holding up class focusing on my unwillingness to make a decision. The rest of my class, predominately African American, verbally displeased and stating their own answers. It made me uncomfortable how quickly, confidently, and proudly they stated their answers. I am only alive because a white man from Indiana came from his state to California and fell in love with my grandmother. That man has done much for me, and his people are my people just as my grandmother's. I refused to forsake a whole group of people to pacify a class and professor and the ordeal left me feeling outside of the campus culture and student body. Over the coming months the distance grew.",
                "Allegra": "There is a lot of alcohol use and drug use (smoking week) among the student in the campus despite the school's policy as a dry campus. As a predominantly black college/university, Howard University does not have the most diversity. This is not entirely a problem but the culture here seems to be predominantly that of an urban African-American culture. Some students here seem to be very narrow-minded, ignorant, and subconsciously intolerant towards those of a different lifestyle. I am Pentecostal/Apostolic and I feel judged for my lifestyle/way of dress.",

By \"true financial aid,\" I am referring to grants, scholarships, and awards that do not require repayment. The cost of tuition continues to be on the rise without no clear plan of how students can defray costs with \"true awards.\" I think the university needs to do a better job of securing this type of aid for its student population.",

Another thing that has happened is that the staff might not answer the office phones or you are taken in a complete circle before your  question is answered.",

It is easier said than done because it semms that once you get into certain organizatinos your freshman year, you have the direct pull to get in to all the other you want to get into. Thus making it hard for new people to achieve.",

Services at Howard can often seem mediocre for the financial investment and prestigous name the university carries. The worst thing about Howard University is that it lacks the professionalism, business tchnique, financial security and stability of many other prestigious universities within the country. The day to day struggles of this HBCU are evident in the day to day life of a Howard student in the classroom, residence life, student union, and last but not least the admistrative and counseling services.",

Not everybody wants to take the initiative to help new-comers and others feel like they belong until major situations happen.",

This along with the slow server on BisonWeb which takes care of financial aid, transcripts, rooming assingments, and registration for classes, has caused students to transfer from Howard University. It is not conducive to a happy environment if the server bogs down everytime a students tries to register for classes or select a living assignment. It is ridiculous and should be changed soon.

If I have a problem, it shouldn't be a problem to see the people I need to see to solve my problem.

I believe that Howard has a unique history and, therefore, ability to make significant changes in the continuing fight for civil rights, equality, and community involvement. To me, then, the worst thing about Howard is that too many of its students get lost into social retreats: fashion, social clubs, and living for social success. Too many have become estranged from life's worthy issues.",

Scholars are appreciated here only through praise, not through monetary assistance. It's an HBCU, so we don't necessaruly have racial issues here, however there is a mjaor class distinction, that is obvious form the time one sets foot one campus. Howard would do well to treat less-financially endowed students with more respect.",

From unreasonable cafeteria hours to incredibly last minute communication, Howard has repeatedly shown that student morale and wellbeing is not a priority. One major example of this is the failure to put down proper materials to prevent thte freezing of precipitation on campus. After one snow, the walkways of both the Upper and Lower Quadrangles were completely frozen over as students trekked to class. This was a very hazardous situation, as many students and professors slipped and fell.",

There is no type of organization in the building and sometimes they even lose your financial aid.",

Registering for classes is almost as hard as staying in to study on a Saturday night when everyone's partying, but at the end of the day it's something you have to do. Registration is difficult because of the lack of space in classes so as a freshman the classes you need, often fill fast.

I advise all of the students to make copies of their financial documents and their class schedule.  Try to pay your tuition and register for your classes before the next semester begins.

In order to ensure that one's grades, money, and records are correct and up-to-date,  one must practically hound the Administration Building's employees.

I was previously diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent nine weeks of aggressive cancer treatment.  From the moment that I was diagnosed with cancer, I lost my sense of self.  I lost myself in having to attend radiation treatment daily and chemotherapy one time per week.  Attending college, after treatment, has allowed me to recapture my sense of self and feel like I am striving to make a difference in my children\u2019s lives once I receive my degree.  The chance to attend college has been so valuable to me because it has revitalized my life.  The experience has allowed me to reach deep inside myself and perform at levels I never knew existed within me.  It has given me the opportunity to learn things about myself that would not be possible without the college experience.  For instance, I have learned how strong I am mentally and physically, having to juggle family responsibilities, school responsibilities, while still trying to recover physically from cancer treatment.  I never knew the depth of this strength until I attended college."

The professors are always welcoming to questions and constantly remind us that it is more than okay to be at community college. They tell us that we are not falling behind our friends who are attending four year colleges and that we are at the same level as they are. I wish that school activities were a lot more announced so that people would get involved more. I enjoy the convenience of the location of my school because you have lots of food choices around you, many pharmacies, convenience stores, and public transportation that is nonstop. The downside about the location is the parking and how ridiculously difficult it is to find a spot and how expensive it can get if you drive to school every day. Another thing I can say about my school is that the advisors are almost never available immediately and it takes at least 2-3 hours just to talk to one. They don't really advise you on your future, really just on what classes to drop and which to keep. I wish HCCC was better in that aspect, but overall it is not a bad school. "

Most high school students have a stigma against community colleges because they believe that the education is not as good and they believe that they aren\u2019t as prestigious as other students who go to 4 year schools. The Professors at Hudson County Community College are amazing and I have never been so motivated about attending school. Not to mention that community college is so much more affordable as well.

How they don't have activities, you go straight home after class where you might not be willing to go home and willing to do an extracurricular activity. I didn't let that get to my head as much, because here I am in Hudson Community College proving other people wrong. This community college gives you many different opportunities for different things.

You think that you are ready to settle and marry and that college does not matter. You think any run of the mill college is great, you think none of the extra fluff matters. No need for any extracurricular activities. No need for internships. College is nothing more than an extension of highschool. \n\nYou are wrong. You are 18 and life isnt over, it is just beginning. You are not an adult. The transition from child to adult is not as simple as the clock striking 12 am on your birthday. The college you pick does matter, those extracurricular activities are not just fun and games. They are important to your growth. You don't need to settle now. Make some friends, learn a few new things, and for goodness sake get an internship! You think you know everything, but there are no right or wrong answers in life.

Once I entered college, I had to learn very quickly, through trial and error, how to inspire and support myself and be my own cheerleader. There have been many days when I felt alone and overcome with the stresses that come along with entering adulthood. I would let my high school self know that if she can motivate herself to succeed when no one is cheering for her, then she will be able to push even harder and succeed even further when people are cheering her on with pompoms, foam fingers and megaphones.

You see, I know that you are incredibly focused on getting great grades and achieveing a perfect GPA, but as you move into your crazy college years you need to remember one thing, balance.  You must understand that although you are going to college to receive a great education and learn all you can about your field, you are also going to discover who you are and what your role is in this world. Don't hide behind your books and watch others live their lives but dive into some activities, meet new people, get out of your comfort zone. Put down the pencil every once in awhile and embrace the world around you. Remember that grades are not what makes you who you are; It is the experiences you have and the way you handle yourself that truly defines you. Don't allow yourself to get sucked into the world of perfection but instead embrace the ability to make mistakes and grow from them; embrace the humanness of yourself and cast aside the need to be perfect.",

It's not about how big a college is that makes it a great college. The most important thing about a college is that you are not just satisfied, but that you absolutley LOVE IT. College is an experience that like high school will come and go. At the end of the day you should love your professors and feel comfortable with them. The best thing about a small college is virtually everyone you know or have at least ran across that person more than once. The main thing about choosing a college is at the end of the day you ask yourself the question \"Does this school fit me and my personality?\" If you answered yes, then the college in which you chose is the college for you.",

Apply to Huntingdon College you'll love it and it will cange your life and you'll feel right at home. Keep taking the ACT don't just settle for the twenty-four you know you can get at least a 27. Get a part time job it feels good to be able to help your parents with some of the bills. Don't let the mean girls get to you because the don't get as far in college as you. Don't stress you can do this and you know you can. Live! just live each day because as soon as you walk across the stage you'll want to go right back so don't wish your way out of your Sr. year.

You don't want to finish school with a huge debt hanging over your head. Once you are in school, stay in school. Do not leave to get married. If you want to marry, then do so, but STAY IN SCHOOL. Otherwise, you may end up like I did--going back to school after a 23-year break. It's much easier to finish the first time.  Also, appreciate your instructors. Listen to and learn from their experiences as well as from the textbooks. Finally, it really is true that you can do anything that you set your mind to. Believe in yourself!",

I would make sure to let myself know that things are going to get tough at times you should never give up on your dreams, even if quiting seems to be easier.  When you get to the point in your life where your life goals have been achieved it will all be worth it.  College may seem like the hardest time in your life, but without your degree, your dreams and goals will not be achieved.

By your sophomore year, you will not be making it home as much as your mother would like. I suggest that you call her at least once a day just to tell her a funny story or update her on what you are involved in because that will save you a lot of grief and yelling. \nYou also need to visit the Career Center. It is never too early to begin making career connections once you figure out what you want to do with your life. (by the way, you should look into the field of publishing--just a thought) \nYou should start keeping a record of your volunteer work, summer jobs, and activities because you will soon need to make a resume, and believe me, it will be difficult to remember everything you have been involved with.\nOh, I almost forgot. Don't get too down hearted when--umm, if--your high school boyfriend/first love breaks your heart. Huntingdon College is full of great people. You might just meet your soulmate.  ;)\n\nHave fun,\nKelsey Loftin",

Tests are bigger, and problems are longer. Learn how to balance social life with academic life early - its all about you and your future. Having said that, the people you will meet throughout your college experience will truthfully be there for the rest of your life. You will laugh with them, you will cry with them, and you will love with them.  If you can allow yourself the perfect balance between those two aspects of your experience at college, you will honestly have the time of your life. Join a fratenity. Play a sport. Debate in a political group. Go to parties.  Participate in class discussions. Live every second of life to its fullest, because college allows for you to really live. Be all that you can be, and do all that you can do - you won't regret it.",

                "Elizabeth ": "I would say to really look into all the possibilities. Your first choice is not always the best one. It is really important to seek out the campuses and talk to people you meet there. Whether it be a teacher, student, or parent. You see so many different perspectives that way then when you only talk to admission offices.  Once you decide on the college that is best for you, get involved. Even if it is something small like a study group, the more time you devote to your school, the more it will give back to you.  My first semester I wasn't very involved on campus, and I thought that school was going to be rough, but during my second semester I got a lot more involved, and I enjoyed everything a lot more. It really does help to be involved in something. The college experience is all what you make it, so I would definitely advise everyone to make the best of it!",
                "Caitlin ": "When it comes to finding the right college, simply obtain as much information about the school as possible.  Being the potential college student you need to decide what you would like to get out of your time there [ study and obtain a quality degree, excel at collegiate sports, have a wild social life, etc.] Pick a college that best suits your needs, dreams, and goals. Be open minded and willing to consider even the craziest offers.  Follow your instincts. You'll know when you've found the right one.  As for the college experience, don't be shy, especially during your first couple weeks. It isn't high school anymore. There aren't the same cliches.  Everyone is willing and anxious to meet new people.  So take advantage of that.  Remember to focus on your schoolwork. Afterall, you are at college to learn. Get a reasonable amount of sleep, don't let your social life intrude with your classes, and take advantage of your school's resources. College is like everything else in that you get out of it what you put in.  Have fun. It's a great experience!",
                "Brandon ": "Remember first that every school is not for every student. There are many factors that go into choosing the campus that is right for you. Secondly, take all the time that you can to choose the right school. Simply put, choosing the place to give $100,000 and spend 4 years of your life is not  something that should be rushed into.  Finally, know who you are. It is always easier to find out what school is your niche to fit into when you know what \"shape\" you are.",
                "Kayla ": "The main advice I think that parents and students should know about finding the right college is that the cost of the school is not the main thing, its the education that the student will be receiving at that instituation that is the main priority. What he or she learns at that college or university will determine his or her future so however much it may cost shouldn't be a huge deciding factor, afterall there are plenty of scholarships and financial aid available so that everyone could attend the school that best fits them. Personally, my parents can't afford to send me to Huntingdon College, I even thought about transfering to a less prostigious and less expensive school so that we could afford it but after many long discussions with my parents we realized Huntingdon was the place for me, the academics were wonderful, I'm about to play two sports as well as get my degree!",

                "Alyssa ": "To the parents, I would say let your child make the final decision.  A school where they are comfortable is where they will more likely succeed.  To students, I would say not to pick a school just because you are a fan of their football team.  That isn't always a good fit.  Make sure that you are comfortable with the school and the campus.  The campus shouldn't be too big or too small depending on your preference.  Also, move away from home.  It will be difficult at first, but being a student who did not live on campus my first year it was difficult to make lots of friends.  No matter what your parents say you are ready to live on your own.  The only way to really find out is to try it out and if it's not for you then move to a school closer to home that fits you.  But the most important advice I could give is to have fun but not so much that you fall behind in school."

It was like to college was closed. The day was supposed to start at 12:30. I got there right at 12:30 pm.  I walked around for about 10 minutes, almost leaving when finally some one came and said hello. So, it was awkward at first. After the initial uneasiness, thing got rolling and I received a personal tour and day on campus. As I was the only student who signed up for that day. It was really great!\n\nHuntington University is a beautiful wooded campus. The staff and admissions people are absolutely top notch compared to other colleges I have visited. I really liked it. Though I have a couple other colleges\n to visit. I have moved Huntington up to 1st on my list."

Class sizes are perfect for me and anyone who would prefer to have the chance to connect with their professors on a good level and relate to them. The dorms are very homey and I feel extremely safe while living on campus. There is not one thing I can say that I dislike about my university. "

The professors are personable so if one wants a personal relationship with the professors, it can be done and it's not a sketchy act. This campus is full of people that want to invest in others, and also people that are completely consumed with the importance of pieces of paper. It is welcoming and the community is near the best that I have ever experienced.",

What I mean by this is that they have been pampered by parents for so long and so much that they have a large sense of self-entitlement and very little in the way of independent thinking.  However, most of them, to an extent, are very nice, social, and do put some level of work into the classes that they care about.  They are very volunteer-centric.

The only thing that annoys me a bit is the feeling that there are clear gender roles that everyone is aware of. When you're at HU, there's this feeling that the guys are there to get an education and a job, but some of the girls are there to get a diploma and find a husband. I live 1/2 way between NYC and Washington DC, so i was raised with the belief that you go to college and get a job - worry about 'the one' later. But i guess the Midwest isn't quite there yet.

If you want something exciting to do, drive up to Fort Wayne 30 minutes north. You can walk from one side of campus the other in less than 10 minutes. HU is big enough that you don't know everyone, but small enough that your proffs know who are. The location took some getting used to. I'm from the east coast, so i'm used to having an ocean nearby, as well as lush, rolling green hills. Huntington and the surrounding areas are flat farmland; but again, it's simply different from what i'm used to."

                "Ryan": "The world is a machine fueled by money.  By coasting idly the world will overrun, overwelm, and consume you. In order to take flight, to keep your head above the clouds,  to maintain a gust below your wings, you must first take the plunge: stepping off whatever foundation you had stood upon before. Diving deep into debt, into the mess of it all, submit yourself to the consternation you wish to triumph.  You will endure many hardships in discovering yourself, discovering your place, and many forms of the term distress. At times you will wish to cut your losses; looking back at what stability you once had back at home. You continue. You must. For every moment you free-fall emotionally, spiritually, financially; you are gaining momentum.  Momentum that will propel you to your aspirations. Do not misunderstand me; the amount of money you pay for school does not bring you success, only oppertunities and introductions. College is an endeavor;  the flight is your success.  \nAs light shines brilliantly encompassed by darkness, triumph flourishes when faced with overwhelming failure.",
                "Christena": "Truthfully, if I could turn back time to when I was a high school senior, I would tell myself to listen to my mom about boys,  to keep my head up and to study hard because education is important to a good future. That at the age of 37,  I am living pay check to paycheck not knowing where the next meal is coming from and so I need to follow through and go to college. I would be more than I am or at a better place in my career. Growing up in a country like Jamiaca where the poverty level is higher than most countries, we have no choice but to follow through with our education but sometimes we get distracted by things that we can't or won't control. Knowing what I know now, I would convince myself that it is better to go to college straight out of high school because it is a much smoother transition.  No to throw away my future on things that are going to be there when I am finish. To fight for the things that I want and to believe in myself and know that I can do it.",
                "Rachel": "Knowing what I know now as a junior in college I would want my high school self to know three very important advice. The first would be to commit yourself to making lots of mistakes. Mistakes teach you important lessons.  The biggest mistake you can make is doing nothing because you\u2019re too scared.  So don\u2019t hesitate, and most importantly don\u2019t doubt yourself. The second would be to find hard work you love doing. I\u2019d tell myself not to base my career choice on other people\u2019s ideas, goals and recommendations.  I\u2019d tell myself not to pick a major because it\u2019s popular, or statistically creates graduates who make the most money. As long as you remain true to yourself, and follow your own interests and values, you can find success through passion.  Perhaps more importantly, you won\u2019t wake up several years later working in a career field you despise, wondering \u201cHow the heck am I going to do this for the next 30 years?\u201d  The third and last advice would be to invest time, and energy in yourself. The more energy spent acquiring pertinent knowledge, the more control you have over your life.",
                "Emily": "I would probably tell myself to research my college options more carefully. Start saving up your money now so that you won't have to worry so much about paying for school in the future. Also, maybe going to a cheaper school would have been a smarter decision.",
                "Brian": "I would tell a Christian student who is attending a public school that they would find it beneficial to do research ahead of time on local churches and on-campus ministries, so that he or she can get plugged in right away and not get caught up in other things and putting Church off.",
                "Sarah": "I would tell my younger self to really take life one day at a time, when your a senior in highschool even though everyone tells you you have your hold life ahead of you , i felt rushed . I was in hurry to get out of highschool enjoy my college life and just have fun. I sooned relized life is way more than just having fun . Life is full of choices, you may not realize as a senior what you do today can effect the rest of your life . as a senior please enjoy your year , all the while know whats important and whats not , never let anyone shatter your dreams and the day you walk across that stage is not the end its only the beginning !",
                "Amy": "I would tell myself to not worry so much and to just take it one day at a time. It's a hard transition and it's okay to struggle with it a little bit. I would tell myself to continue to study hard through the end of my senior year and not give up with the end in sight; but, I would also remind myself that I am preparing for college and still developing study habits even in those last months of college. I would also warn myself to be careful with my money because paying for college is a daunting and overwhelming task and it is not fun to be bogged down with worry about making payments, so work hard and save a lot, it will be well worth it. Overall I would just tell myself to relax more and not worry about so much stuff related to transitioning to college.",
                "Jordan": "If I were to go back to high school as a senior, I would give myself the advice to take AP classes or Dual Enrollment as early as possible. They always seemed so expensive and a lot of work, compared to the general education classes of high school that were not very prepatory at all. I enrolled as a college Freshman with no credits, and a desire to take more classes than could fit in my four years. I have had to take summer classes and online classes outside of my regular class load, to work towards the degrees I desire. Coming in with atleast one semester credit opens up oppurtunity for studying abroad, possible minors, room for electives, etc. Partaking in these classes in high school could have saved me currently.  The realization of how demanding certain majors are; and the benefits of preparing yourself beforehand. The realization of  how fortuante you are as well; through family, friends, sports, classloads, etc. Moving to a different state for college, I learned how much I take for granted, and how differently I would have treated friendships, or experiances that I had in high school.",
                "Sara": "The advice I would want to convey if speaking to myself as a high school senior, is to have more confidence in your abilities and truly apply yourself.  Being from a small suburban town, as a high school student looking at where my future could take me, I was not opening my eyes very wide. As a college graduate, who worked full time through my Bachelor's degree and is now also working full time during my preparation for a Master's program, I would tell myself to believe in my choices rather than second guess myself. I would apply myself to my studies and open myself up to such opportunities as studying abroad or internships with different organizations. College life can be fun and exciting, but you also have to focus on post graduate priorities rather than just live in the here and now. Exposing yourself to different opportunities will help in providing the confidence in your future goals.  Going to college sets the foundation for your life long career. It helps instill the confidence needed when making decisions,  and the confidence in ones abilities to achieve what they set out to, regardless of life's obstacles.",
                "Tyler": "I would tell myself not to go to a private school, because of the expensive cost. I would have taken more time to apply and look for scholarships I could possibly be awarded to help pay for college so I do not have the extreme debt when I graduate that I am going to have. I also would force myself to be more conscious with my money and how I spend it. With my social life, I would let myself go and be more outgoing, rather than so reserved. Finally, with regards to studying I would take more time to focus on the classes that I did not care about because they did not apply to my major, and in the end, brought my GPA down. Although in college we are still \"kids\" I would tell myself to focus on the task at hand, and to worry about having fun later in life when I have a job.",
                "Mandy": "I would have applied myself better. I would of ran for leadership offices instead of just being a member. I would of tried out for school sports. I would of taken college classes in high school to be applied toward a degree in college. Oh yeah, Mandy, Don't screw it up!",
                "Marissa": "Look more into colleges that have your major in a different aspect, not just where you think your friends will be going. Also, do not lose focus of your goal, yes it will get hard and you won't want to do anything anymore but keep going.",
                "Shanay": "The first thing that I would tell my high school senior self is that I should fill out my roommate match form better, because there is only so much messiness that I can take.  My advice following directly after that would range from \"don't forget to bring your life savings in quarters for laundry\" to \"you really don't need that massive stack of notebooks that you've been stockpiling in your room, because you probably won't use them for notes anyway.\"  I would also let myself know that I shouldn't get my hopes up too high for a new and more intellectual school, as high school mentality does not magically disappear the moment you get a diploma in your hand.  Give it time and they shall mature soon enough.  And by the way, senior self, you aren't nearly as mature as you think you are, so you'll probably fit right in.  Oh, and I would definitely tell myself to brush up on every obscure film fact known to man, because it is apparently a hobby of college students to show off their film prowess to prove just how hip and happening they are.",
                "Shonah": "As a senior graduating high school, I was both cocky beyond all words and as terrified as a church mouse. Now, believing that I have matured significantly, I would tell myself this: do not let fear run your life, and don\u2019t leave other people to do the dirty work. Our one purpose in life is to love God and love others; we are instructed so in the Bible. Because of my fear that kept me from taking chances and the belief that someone else would take care of those hurting people that I refused to leave my comfort zone for, I missed out on a plethora of amazing opportunities. My school is very service based. There were hundreds of opportunities for me to get involved\u2014I was offered chances to take multiple mission trips and participate in many projects to better the community. If I could tell my high school self anything, I would make sure to stress the importance of getting involved and jumping on those chances to serve others.",
                "India": "I would tell myself to never slip up and get lazy and keep working hard, maybe even harder then you already do work. You are really blessed to have taken AP courses because you will be prepared to handle a heavy course load, however working harder than you do right now will be very beneficial. Never give up if something seems hard, take a break to clear your mind and get right back to studying and be the best student that you can be.",
                "Douglas": "Hayden, you may feel like high school is a terrible thing to have to go through. In some ways, you are right, but it gets better. College is a blast, and you will love it. The people in college really want to be there and learn. College is where you are going to meet the friends that will last you forever. There are so many activities that you can participate in, and you don't go to class allday for a whole year. So, just relax and take it easy. Everything is going to be just fine.",
                "Cody": "Work really hard to save up money for college. Be a more outgoing individual with confidence. Don't be afraid to take any risks, and look at all the opportunities around so that you can leave your options available. You cannot please everyone so choose your friends wisely because the friends you choose is normally how well you will do in life; if you are with a bunch of gamers who dont pay attention in class, that is what you will be; and if you are with a bunch of studious individuals, you will most likely become studious yourself.",
                "marilyn": "I currently have a Associated Arts degree, Bachelors degree in Liberal Studies, Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. I am considering returning to school to ger a Special Education Credential  I have gone back in time because I am currently attending junior college and this time I see how I could have enjoyed it so much more. i was never interested in school and had so many distractions that I just never considered attending college.  I wanted to have children and marry someone who would support me.  Habit learned are hard to break. It took me so long to actually enjoy and appreciate what I was learning and how it was making me see things in a whole different way. When I first started to attend school It was more of an obligation and that actually made it difficult to learn.  I felt like I didnt belong and that this was not the thing for me, but kept going because I did not want to be a quiter. I see now that it was me and my attitude towards school that made it difficult. Dont look at school as an obligation, but as a gift to the mind and person.",
                "Gabby": "You need to make the choice for yourself.  No one else should pressure your or influence where you go. Even though college is expensive, you need to pick somewhere you are going to enjoy yourself for the next 4 years.",
                "Diamond": "I would tell myself i need to listen and concentrate on my senior year. It's the most important to help me get into college and persue a career to help benefit me in my future. I did horrible in high school and im now having trouble in college. so definately cocentrate and apply for as many scholarships as possible to help me.",
                "Rodney": "The status of the school does not always portray what the school os about, so make sure that you find a school that you feel at home with and one that you are easily able to see yourself attending. If you are lost during the student visit day, then you may be lost during the semester. Look into what the college offers YOU, individually, not just as a student, but as a person that has qwerks and opinions.",
                "Danielle": "I have gotten alot out of college thus far, i have learned that in college is where i get the real scoop on universal issues and life. It has really opened my eyes and has caused me to start thinking outside of myself, and the life i live in today. I feel challegened and i get to grow ,  learn, and become inspired. school has also played and important part of my adulthood, i say that because in every class i take i learn more of who i am, what i believe in, what i dont believe in. Whatever i have known in that past to be true, professors help to better understand and lern more about my beliefes. I have also been able to find amazing friends, apart of being in school allowed me to find people that i enjoyed being around. Every year i find that my groups of friends change, and it reflects the inside of me. So, i will sum it up by saying. School is hard but worth it.",
                "Zachary ": "I have found that college, especially obtaining a nursing degree, is very difficult and requires a great amount of study time and work time. I can see why nursing takes a great deal of discipline and dedication. It has been valuable to attend this school to show me how important it is to go to college and work hard.  It has also been valuable to attend to acquire a degree for a safety net, in case my career choice changes, I always have something to fall back on.",
                "Kenny ": "At Huntington I have been able to grow spiritually while learning the basics of what every student at a liberal arts college learns.  Although classes have been interesting and informative I have found chapels and other worship times even more interesting and educational. Every professor somehow incorporates God into their lesson almost everyday and it is just good to see how He can really be involved in all things. I have also been blessed with a great group of guys on my floor that all praise God for everything and we all worship Him together.",
                "Josh ": "To this point in my college career, I have been able to learn much more than just academics. Yes, the education has been great, and I have learned things in the classroom I could have never learned outside, but more importantly I have grown up. Learning how to live in a community has taught me so much about myself, and so much about how the world works. Going to college I have gained life-long friends that are more than just people to hang out with, they are people I consider dependable and always there for me. Before going to college, I depended on myself for support and for answers, in college I am able to lean on the great relationships I have developed to help me understand and gain what I need to know in order to accomplish my goal of being successful in the real world one day.",
                "Jillian ": "My college experience so far is incomparable to almost any other college experience. My freshman year I attended Taylor University Fort Wayne with plans of attending it for my entire four years. Sadly, that school was shut down, but we were allowed to finish out the year.  So that year became focused on what community really is. I was able to bring that here to Huntington University. Between these two schools I have learned that there is so much more to a college education than papers and tests. There are people, there are questions of identity, understanding, faith, world views, philosophies, mottows, life long friendships to be formed and found. In my college experience I have learned to roll with uncertainty, to work towards investing in every interaction with my fellow students, I have learned that at some point one must choose what the focus of their life will be. We have to choose between investing in people, in lifting them up, or focusing on the paperwork, the grades, and our own personal agendas for that day. We have to decide what is most important to us, the lives of others or papers and office work.",
                "Laura ": "College gave me the confidence not to know the answers. Before I came to school, I saw everything as black or white, good or bad, right or wrong. It had to be one or the other. Grey areas made me uncomfortable. But today I can see all sides of an issue -- as there's usually more than just two -- and feel comfortable with not taking sides.  I can evaluate what makes the good arguments good and the poor arguments poor, but I am not required to make a definite conclusion on which one is right. That is the most valuable lesson I've learned from college. I don't have all the answers, and I don't have to.",
                "David ": "If I could talk to myself as a high school senior about the transition to college, I'd tell myself that it won't be what I'm expecting. Sometimes it'll be better, sometimes it'll be worse... but mostly it's just different. I'd tell myself to hang in there through that rough first semester because it gets better in the second, no matter how hard it is to believe in the first semester. I'd tell me to study hard and work hard, but to take time to goof off and do nothing with people sometimes. I'd say not to take Chemistry, Western Civilization, and Writing all in the same semester. I'd tell me that I'm actually going to college, and that I'll like it, though it won't be where or when I expect it to be now. Mostly though, what I'd say about what to expect is not to expect anything, because life never ends up being the way I expect it.",

There are the nerds, the jocks, the frat boys, the suck-ups, the theater people, the people-obsessed-with-their-grades, and the music people.  All the movies indicate this is true about college life. But here?s what I say: it?s true, to an extent. \nIn college, it?s natural for students to gravitate toward people who share similar interests. It?s easy to form cliques. My advice to any high school senior is this: try to float from clique to clique. Hang out with the nerds, but also spend some time with the theater people. Get to know a jock. Don?t commit to one clique, but make friendships with people from several cliques.\nNow, before you say this is impossible, know this: I am an athlete and a mostly A student. These are considered to be clashing cliques: the jock versus the nerd. However, I?ve been able to make friends in both groups, and my college experience has been richer because of it. \nDon?t get sucked into one group. Consciously make the effort to diversify your friends, and you?ll be glad you did.",

You will be floored by what you can accomplish by ignoring your fear, and saying yes.\nMost of all, dream.

You have to pass an exam to get college credit for the AP classes you take.  You know you do not do well on stressful tests.  You will only pass your AP English exam which will earn you 3 semester hours at college.  You will not pass your AP government or your AP calculus exams for which you will earn nothing.  However, you will earn 8 semester hours for the dual enrollment Anatomy & Physiology class you will take.  It will not require an exam for college credit.  You will only need to enroll at the local university through your teacher to get the 8 semester hours.  Because of your 11 credit hours prior to entering college, you will be one of the first freshman to sign up for fall classes at your summer orientation!   \n\nContinue to work hard and maintain your 4.0.  If you do so, only you and Megan will be valedictorians in May, and you will earn $2250 in scholarships!  Graduation will come a lot quicker than you ever imagined.  \n\nSincerely,\nSonya Yoder",

So choose a school you feel comfortable with, even if it isn?t the absolute best on a pro/con list.\n?Choose a school with many strong programs in various majors and broad opportunities, as your interests are likely to change over the course of your college experience.\n?Spend the night on campus. This gave me a greater feel for the students, community, and interests at each university.\nAs for advice on making the most of your college experience:\n?Don?t go into college hoping to drastically change and be the ?new and improved? you.  Rather, recognize that your most real relationships and joys will come from being genuine about your talents, past, and interests.\n?Most importantly, choose to serve others. Choosing to serve your roommate, your classmates, your university, and the community will bring quality to your college experience, encourage personal growth, and allow you to make a meaningful impact.",

You are going to be at this college for four years, you need to spend more than four hours seeing if it fits you and your goals. \nAlso don't write off a school purely because of a label. You may not want to go to school in the city, but some campuses are able to create that small-town feel right in the middle of a metropolis!\nWhen you get your financial aid packages, don't freak out and immediately go with the biggest package. Call the college's financial aid officer and talk to them. I was able to get more from my school after showing them the offers I was getting from other schools.

If you want a party school with huge classes don't look at schools that are private schools.  To parents even though you would like your kids to go to your college or university don't tell them that is where they are going to go.  Let your kids find a shcool that is right for them.  \n\nStudents when you are at school you need to find a balance between your school work and your social life.

If you are looking for the social life, try to talk with people who have gone there and/or to the residence life staff to get a feel for what the school offers.  If you also are very interested in the physical environment, go to visit and see if it is a fit.  This last part is key.  It is really important, if possible to visit several schools to make sure it feels right.\nAs far as making the most of the college experience, I am not a person to say try everything.  I would say meet lots of new people and in order to do this get very involved in campus sponsored events and random activities in the dorms.

Your college experience starts with you being happy with where you are and expands as you start enjoying your pick even more as time progresses.  When you start at your college, be social but focus on your school work as well.

The class sizes rarely if ever breach 50, and the professors are all experts in their field with decades of experience who want to see you succeed. The food is great, and the facilities they offer are crazy. The video program, in particular, is phenomenal in regards to facilities. Within your first semester in the Video Production major students will be using industry-standard cameras and editing software. Husson is a very hands-on school, and you're always learning something new, plus as you build a relationship with your professors, you're also making connections that will make entering the workforce much easier."

It isn't a big party school, but people can go off campus to party, UMO is pretty close by. Husson's in the middle of Bangor, so there are a lot of shops and restaurants around, but when you're on campus it doesn't feel like you're in the middle of a city. It feels safe and comfortable. "

Push forward toward the future, but keep yourself fully present in the now. Take in all that is around you. It has shaped you and molded you into who you are.

I would make sure that I learned the proper way to apply myself and how to study properly. Since being at college, I have learned that I never really learned how to study. That has been very hard for me since being here. I would also tell myself to stay true to who I am. I lost sense of who I am when I came here and I think if I was more comfortable with who I am to begin with, that wouldn't have happened.",
                "Brian": "My advice would be to save money! College is very expensive, take the time to apply for scholarships on focus on your grades.  Get your GPA boosted and apply for every single scholarship available. And once in college work hard and everything will fan out fine.",

                "Brittney": "In the major I chose, it is hard to make friends because everyone is very competitive.  I would advise myself to go out and make friends outside of the friends I knew before I came to Husson.  I would worry less about my grades and more about the information I was learning.  Good grades do not justify how much you actually retained from previous semesters.  Lastly, I would breathe. College is stressful, but it is a learning point in your life.  School can be horrifying, and an amazing experience all at the same time.  If you can find something to do that relaxes you and gives you a break, do it!",
                "Tia": "I would tell myself that college is alot harder than what people make it seem to be. I never really had to study in highschool and I found out really fast once I got to college how much I had to study. For one exam, I studied for 8 hours. Since I am a nursing major I do have more studying to do than some other majors. However, I didn't expect it to be this hard. I would also tell myself that transitioning into college takes time since you are living in a new place that is extrememly small and with a roomate. Also the food isn't like homecooking. Overall I love being at college, but it can be stressful and alot of work",

If I could go back in time and talk to myself, I would tell myself that college is going to be the turning point in my life, the point that makes me the man I will become. I would tell myself that the shyness and social anxiety I have carried with me all my life will disappear after just three months of much needed counseling.  I would tell myself to not worry about your confidence level, because I will soon be able to shake off the things that the bullies have always tried to instill in me and walk with my head held high. You may not find a girl right away that could change your life but by time you got into your junior year, you believe you have found the love of your life. You can handle college, the academics, the social aspects; you will even become a major part of the student government. Your life is going to change forever, you just wait.",

When I was looking at colleges I was stressed about how everything would turn out and how I would transition from high school to college.  I did not know how housing would work or if I would like my roommate. I worried about the loans and how they would all work out. But when I got to college I realized that all that stress was not needed. My housing was fine; I am rooming with a great roommate. I received all the loans that I needed which paid for college and some left over for books. If I could give wisdom to my former self I would tell him not to worry.",
                "Hannah": "Going back in time in order to be a high school senior would be a blessing and a curse. The great thing about college is that I'm beginning to learn about things that actually interest me, whereas in high school I was limited to a curriculum prescribed by the state. It would be a curse to travel back in time to high school because of that one limitation. Although I enjoy the challenge and complexity of college classes, there is one reason that I would love to go back to high school. The blessing about being able to travel back in time to be a senior again is that I could sign up for more challenging classes, as well as partake in college prerequisit courses at my local University. If I had taken more challenging classes in high school, it may have sacrificed my straight A report card, but in turn I would have gotten the experience I needed for the demanding college classes that I am now a part of. If I had taken some prerequisit classes, I would have more time in my schedule this year which may have made the transition to college easier for me.",

But, with more emphasis, I would tell myself to be courageous, accepting of others, and willing to let other people in my life. \n         I would tell myself that yes, boys will end up likeing you, and you shouldn't be afraid of that. Don't hide from them because you're not use to the attention, or because (you think) you're too afraid to make the first move. Boys like that in fact, when girls talk to them. I'd also talk about respecting people- not that you were ever disrespectful, but sometimes you weren't as considerate as you could be. Open doors, talk to people in the lunch line, never be afraid to wave and yell someones name across a room just to say 'hello'. Yes, it's intimadating, but it's worth it to make the great friends you'll have. Finally, don't regret anything you do or didn't do.",
                "Chelsea": "If I could go back and talk to my high school self I would tell them to work harder in all parts. The best advic I could give myself would be to focus on school work and learn how to study. That the hardest part about the college transistion is going from minimal studying to studying four hours a day. Also I would tell myself to work focus more on finding scholarships.  College is expensive and with out scholarships debt is inevitable. I wish I had applied to more scholarships when I still id not have to pay for anything instead of applying for many while haveing to juggle school and work.",

                "Kendra ": "I have realized that college can bring me to places in this world that other organizations may not be able to give me. College and especially my program will give me not only knowledge of kinesiology and practices in physical therapy but also professionalism. I will become a great leader in my community and perhaps nation wide. I will be respected by my peers and colleauges. Through my college experience I have also learned how to better manage my time, which will be helpful when I am a physical therapist.  I have been exposed to a variety of students and it has better opened my mind to the diversity of Maine and of this country. I enjoy the closeness of my university becuase it allows me to get closer to the new variety of people I am exposed to. I have also learned the difficulty of paying for college. I have been paying for school with little assistance from my parents, and I have been taking advantage of my work study and other scholarships. However, I realize the importance of college to maintian a stable paycheck, which may be invaluble in this country today.",
                "Krista ": "Since I have started college, I have a whole new perspective on life and just how valuable an education really is. Making the transition from high school to college, I was unaware what to expect. High school was very restricting but being a college student means more freedom. A student either has to sink or swim and realize that the professors are not longer going to remind you again and again to do your work. It is up to you, the student, to take care of everything and ask questions if necessary. I have really enjoyed college thus far as I feel I have taken so much from it. The classes are more challenging but they expand your mind to think about things in a different perspective than we have before. I know college will help my in the long run because I am bettering myself and will be bettering my future with a positive career as well.",
                "Carrie ": "My college experience has been a wild one.  I am in the English Pre-law major which is a four year program, however I have been motivated to complete it in only two years.  I am beyond busy, going to classes, homework, essays, studying, having a part time job, having family time, and of course some type social interactions at least one night a week.   My first semester I was beyond exhausted pulling two or three all nighters in a row, making myself sick.  What I have taken out of my college experience is time management for sure.  In my 2nd semester, I am in bed by 12 and get plenty of rest.  Having better time management skills has allowed me to grow and bloom into a better student.  \n     It is valuable for me to attend college because I need to make a life for myself and for my future family.  I am anxious to start my life and what better way to start off my own life then having a college degree?  I have to write my own book, and my book needs to have a degree to be successful.",
                "Tiffany ": "Before I entered college i was a straight A ,B student that never drank or partied, as many of my classmates chose to do.  Once I got in college all that changed. I befriended the wrong person. This person that I became friends with drank everynight and every weekend.  At first when she would ask me if I wanted to drink I replied \"No thank you\". After a while she would call me lame and peer pressure me into drinking. Not wanting to deal with the peer pressure anymore, I decided to drink as well.  That one time turned into every weekend, which  pushed my homework to the side and I  would not get it done until right before classes started. My grades begin to be not as high as they were. After a while I finally realized that drinking all the time was hurting my chances of doing well in college.  I decided to not be friends with this person anymore.  If i could go back and talk to myself, I would tell myself not to get involved with people like that because it not only brought my grades down but it also put my future career in jeopardy.",
                "Michelle ": "One of the most important things that you could do is learn to limit your spending. Trying to pay for college is really difficult, so making sure that you have money saved up is important. Another thing to make sure that you pay attention to is your spending when you ge into college as well. Along with that, remember that you are paying for your education now. Failing a class is no an option, or else you are losing hundreds of dollars that you will never see again.  You are going to have to be self-motivated to do your work. Teachers are not going to follow you to get your work in like in high school. You need to stay on top of your work and finish everything on time, but at the same time make sure that you do a good job on it.",
                "Christie ": "The majors available and type of college (4 year, 2 year, etc) are very important for future students to consider.  Although one does not need to know the specific major they want, it is important to think of whether they want a college with specialized majors or a more generalized liberal arts school.  I would also reccommend getting involved in a lot of activities that one enjoys.  This is a great way to meet new people who have similar interests and will help one to learn time management skills.  I would also suggest visiting the schools before deciding where to apply because often the environment there can sway you favorably or disfavorably.  I think overall one needs to pick a college based on how happy they feel they will be there.  A person who gets accepted to a prestigous school may not be comfortable with the rigorous workload.  College only happens once, and no matter what school one chooses to attend, there are an endless number of ways to make it an experience to remember.  Choose wisely, but still follow your heart!",
                "Jason ": "I would explain to myself that the transition is a lot easier than you anticipate.  Do not worry about what your classmates will think of you.  The classes are challenging, but if you read your textbook assignments and put in the need hours of studying you will succeed.  Also, remember that you need time for yourself. Enjoy meeting new people and take in all the new experiences that you can.  Your college years are ones you will never forget. So live  it up, and become the success you wish to be. Goodluck,  and trust me I know you will do fine.",
                "Jen ": "If I had the opportunity to talk to my high school self, I would advise following my gut feeling about picking a major and stick with it.  I have always been fascinated with the Real Estate profession, and miraculously there was a college in my home state that offered a great Real Estate degree program.  I completed my first year and was able to receive licensure a year early, so I dropped out of the program and went into the field.  Well, self, it?s a two year program for a reason and I was sadly under qualified without a degree. All the time I?d invested in school was wasted because I could not work in the field without a degree.  I was blinded with the rush to practice Real Estate that I thought I could learn on the job as I went along, but that is not the case at all.  \n\nAs a high school senior I had no idea how valuable a degree was.  It?s taken me seven years to get my act together and go back to school.  I wish I had stuck with college when I started ? no matter what.  Knowledge is power!",
                "Obed ": "College is the key to a great successful future. find out what you want to do in life, and what are the required skills. It  is a good thing to get started early, the more you know about the major you want to persue, the more prepare you will be  when you're actually there in College. Know that half work does not get you in College, make sure you give all you have in all your homework and on your exams, and you'll get in the College that you dreamed about.",
                "Chad": "Quite honestly the first thing I would say to myself is keep studying.  I would insist that college is very important and not to have any doubts on whether or not I would survive in that type of atmosphere.  I would remind myself that all of this studying will actually pay off and that it is actually giving me a leg up on what I will actually be doing in college.  I would advise myself to have just a little bit of fun and to make friends and not be shy because I don't know what I would do without my friends here in college now. I would suggest getting all paperwork done for college early so as to not worry about late admissions. I would say to myself that college can be fun if you learn to interact with others and can be very rewarding as long as I keep applying my knowledge to what HUSSON University has to offer me. Lastly, I would say that the knowledge I have received from my professors, friends, and HUSSON college itself has made me a better, stronger, and more confident person. I would say believe in yourself.",

                "Christin ": "My given advice would be to find the college that is the best fitting for you. I believe that to learn the most and get the most out of your environment you need to be comfortable as well as stimulated. Make sure the college is the right size and in the best fitting comfortable environment [examples: city, country, moderate mixture], aslo make sure the ratio of students to professors are accessible for you.  I believe classroom size is a huge key to learning make sure it is a comfortable size for you to learn your best from.  Another important aspect your college needs is to have lots of extra carricular activities such as clubs, intermural sports, dances, frats/soriorities, and other activities such as cookouts.  I believe all of this can infulence a positive experience in college.",

I come from an extremely affluent community and all anyone talked about was the \"right\" schools. I thought to myself the \"right schools\"? How is anyone but me going to know where I'm going to happiest at school based off of statistics? Just because a school has a prominent name and your parents went there doens't mean you have to.  Be accepting and open minded of your childs whants and needs.  What you want might not me right for your kid. I lived around all these kids that were applying to the Ivys and were constantly stressed and paranoid about it. Once they got there they weren't even happy. My school, Husson mught not be w well know school in the United states but thats ok with me because I'm happy. Its totally out of my element and I love it.

Whether the college has social activities or is strictly academic driven.   Academically driven colleges are wonderfully to get degrees from but without social activities, they become extremely stressful colleges to attend.  I would strongly recommend seeing the college and talking to professors and students.  Test the learning environment by attending classes you may be required to take.  Do not base your opinion on a college by its website or catalog.  Students looking at colleges should understand the cost and the estimate of extra fees so they can account for the financial burden they will carry while and after attending.  I would recommend definitely talking to current students at the college to get honest answers to help you make the right choice for their future.  Students are what create the college so feeling accepted and safe on campus are keys to the right college.   To find out what college is right for you do lots of research and comparing because you will end up putting lots of money and spending most of your time at the college of your choice.",

It is really important that everyone has someone that believes in them.  Education is what makes or breaks a person and this is a crucial time to give positive reinforcement.  Also, don?t push your son or daughter to do something that you want them to do.  Let them apply to where they want and for what they want.  They are going to college to make their dreams come true.  Not yours.  Also, it is very important to be there for them night and day.  They will be going through tough situations alone and will need a shoulder to lean on.  For any student, make sure you can prioritize your time.  It is hard to balance studying and a social life, but it is possible!  College is where you make lots of great memories.

Another thing to look for is the cars in the parking lots that the students drive  because it tells a lot about the type of students that attend the school.

Husson as a campus large enough to support several very successful education programs. Because of its smaller size, classes are interactive and participatory in nature.

It's a very unique situation, where a person is able to know all sorts of different people  who have comepletely different majors.

I've visited a lot of schools and I can say I've seen worse at Keene and UMaine (Orono).  Husson lacks the security of job security after graduation.  I wish they could line up more oppurtunities."

Make sure your head is in the right place with helping people sometimes they can take advantage of your niceness. \n2) Although you might go through some hardships, whether at home or school; you need to push through.

The friends you make will be with you forever. CHOOSE WISELY!\n5) Always pray!

Balance your time, take advantage of your sources, and most of all have fun , but do it responsibly.

Also, don't worry about making friends, it's so easy. You are going to find friends and become so close with them in such short of time, you won't be able to believe what happened.

The transition is going to be difficult especially money wise but just keep your head on straight because you will get through everything eventually just stay on your studies, volunteer , apply for interships, make friends who could also be your support group,  and attend church because god is always there for you so why not show your appreciation.

However, it was difficult balances, work, school and personal time to relax and focus on the upcoming weeks. Scholarships would have allowed me more time to focus on books and less time working for another.

It is important to focus on school work but a balance also has to be met. If  you just stay in your room and study all the time, you will drive yourself crazy. I would also tell myself do not be afraid to speak up. I was very shy as a senior but I learned from college engaging gets you farther.

I would also advise myself to study very hard for the SATs throughout highschool and to never procrastinate. The act of procrastination in high school can result of failing grades for an individual. It is very crucial that you work exceptionally hard because your GPA will determine if you can get into the college you deserve. I say that to say this, never settle when it comes to your education.

In todays society, it is extremly hard to harness a \"Good\" career without some sort of college education on your belt.

I would tell myself not to become so overly involved in extra-curricular activities that it interferes with studying and going to class.  I would tell myself to be aware of my surroundings and what I tell certain people. Everyone you think is your friend is definitely not your friend. Another important thing that I would tell myself is to find out who I am. I wouldn't be swayed to do something that could never benefit me. If you stand for nothin, you will fall for anything. Lastly, I would tell myself that nothing worth achieving comes without hardwork and dedication.",

Making sure that i made time for studying and/or make study groups, go to tutoring for every class at least once or twice a week, and to begin to learn to manage money.  Learn how to save every penny and only buy the most important things. In order for me to do this i would tell myself to purchase a planner or a wall calender that can show me we what needs to be done. If something is in my face it is harder to avoid it or procrastinate, so, i know for a fact it will get done. That, I believe, is the best advice I could give myself  if I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior.",

Another thing i would tell my self is dont give up. Dont give up on your school work keep trying your best. Dont give up on finding scholarships i know its hard but dont give up because every penny counts when it comes to paying your tuition. Just get back up[ and try harder. I would also tell my self to get involved in extracuricular activities because colleges love to see that you are active in some kind of sport of club. In high school i didnt participate in any activities so when i filled out my college application that field was blank and i wish i had some kind of activity to fill in those blanks.",

I would advise myself of the importance, of staying on top of my work and how having a schedule can make things go by a little smoother.

I expected to get a basketball scholarship and e able to do the same things in college. I did not get a basketball scholarship, I got an academic scholarship. The scholarship that I received requires me to maintain a 3.2 grade point average. The transition was hard because I had never had to study before, and there was no turning  work in late so I was definitely in for a rude awakening.

I would look at different colleges to determine who has the best degree plan and make campus visits to speak to administration and instructors.  I would attend all my classes each day to ensure I could get the best grades possible to secure my future career.   Last but not least, I would tell myself that college is not as bad as it looks and that making it on your own is a part of growing and being responsible.

You do not want to end up in a developmental class that do not count towards your major or towards your transript: All it would do is mess up your gpa if you don't take it seriously. Also develop good study  habits and write good notes that will help you succeed come test time. Stay focused it is ok to have fun but don't let the fun take over you, because if you come out with a low gpa your first couple years in college it will be very difficult to come back from. Use your teachers get to know them  make sure they see and know your face because it shows that your making an effort to them and they will be more willing to help you out by giving you and extra assinment to  bring up your grade.",

We have activities every so often and a nice amount of clubs for all the students  to participate in. The classes are a  nice size for students and teachers to become familiar with one another, and provide easy access to partake in any form of guidance for the student. But the cafeteria foods and the town itself, are possibly the only downsides of going to Hutchinson Community College. The food is not best( almost the worse) and the tiny town is more of a retirement area. "

The campus life is great, I loved walking out of class and finding different organizations offering free doughnuts and hot cocoa or there could be music pumping outside with inflatables and nachos waiting to be eaten. Although the many activities offered were very fun, my favorite thing is the quality of instructors that you get at this college. Each teacher is easily accessible and help make even the toughest of classes not seem so terrible. I love Hutchinson Community College and I am sad to be leaving it this spring."

Embrace every moment with your family while still living at home becasue once you leave for college, the relationship with them will dwindle.  Never pass up an opprotunity to make a difference in someone else's life becasue you never know how big of an impact it will have on their life and what they will do with it.  Live every day like it is your last because one of your close friends will pass away unexpectedly due to a car crash.

There is no need to panic and stress myself out if my major is still unknown.  Second I would causion myself in opening up my schedule for more school activites and assignments rather than to worry about a part-time job and money.

Try and narrow down the career you want in life so that way are not pulling unnecessary funds that will put you in debt later in life.   \n\n    Taking the time to plan for your future is always important.  All of the decisions you make from here on out will effect you in aspect of life.  Know that its never to late to go back to school if you deiced to take a break.

The professors/teachers are personable/helpful , and it's college town (Pocatello ID) is very stereotypical of Idahoans being friendly/neighborly. Even though Pocatello ID has about 55,000 people, I'm always running in to people I know while doing normal everyday activities outside of the college campus. The college enrollment has declined since I've started here in 2014 due to budget cuts which is evidenced by fewer class offerings per semester, and  many classes are online in the College of Arts and Sciences (Fine Arts & Humanities, History, Sociology, Social Work, Psychology, Anthropology, Art, Communication, English, Performing Arts, Political Science, and Global Studies). Also, the college has a good reputation for it's College of Technology Programs, Accounting/Finances, Health Occupations, Masters in Taxation, and Sciences (Chemistry, Geology, and Physical/biological). Additionally, the college will prepare students for their future career, for graduate school, and for life. Also, jobs are plentiful on campus and in the nearby community. It's a high chance that one will need to relocate due to more career/job opportunities elsewhere  upon graduation. Lastly, the campus is peaceful/relaxing which is conducive for studying.\n"

Every time I have gone in to meet with the staff they have been friendly, helpful, and have left me feeling impowered to succeed. \nIdaho State University has been actively helping the state of Idaho by allowing students to access education through out the state. I have the option to pursue my entire degree without moving to their primary campus. \nThey also have very affordable tuition that makes pursuing a degree realistic and possible. The financial aid staff has been their every step of the way helping me find access to all the aid I can qualify for. I can get my degree without paying off student loans for the rest of my life. \nI would absolutely recommend Idaho State University to anyone ranging from a graduating high school student to an adult returning to school to further themselves. \n"

On-campus housing wasn't my cup of tea, but I would highly encourage people to give it a try if they don't know anyone else on campus, or if they do, invite them to be your roommate, it makes the whole experience more...comfortable.\nAlso, while Pocatello isn't the best town to live in, the views are incredibly beautiful, just be sure to look out for mountain lions during certain seasons.

When i first arrived i was worried that there would be class rivalries like in high school with the hazing of freshmen, but i was pleasantly surprised.  People in classes are friendly and eager to talk to their neighbors and nobody really cares about age or nationality.  There are many older adults in many of my classes coming back to further their education and it was so surprising to see that they treat me like a fellow classmate rather than a naive 18 year old who is young enough to be their daughter.  Also I've met many international students and it's awesome to see how well they fit in so well with the student body.  It's funny to hear their perspectives on Americans and the college lifestyle.

There is a pretty diverse set of individuals here--everyone is bounds to find someone to connect with and enjoy the college years with. \r\n\r\nAnother great bonus is that ISU attracts a lot of foreign exchange students. This is due to our International Programs Office. They send recruiters around the world. There are over 400 international students here--bringing a wealth of cultural knowledge to our campus. Saudi Arabia, Nepal, India, China and all the African countries together have the top amount of students. Because of this we have diversity events all the time. We always have a International Night once a year which includes food and entertainment for a Saturday night. Then each group of students has a night to represent their culture. Nights like African Night are really popular and so much fun.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I like about the students here is their political acceptance. Yes, I would say a majority of the campus is conservative, however, independents and democrats are not left out. People aren't mean to them or anything absurd like that. ",

Most of the foreign kids are here through the international students program as there are rarely foreigners who are native to the area.  Most of the Black kids are here because they have to be highly skilled at one or more NCAA sports.  Other than that it is a nearly homogenous group of Latter-Day-Saints, I say nearly because the Pocatello Campus is probably the most diverse place in Pocatello, ID.   I myself am Black, more often than not I am the only African American in the classroom, and when there are others it seems like they are recruited solely for sports teams.  The definition of \"racism\" is constantly changing and is different from place to place; that being said I beleive there is a high amount of \"racism\" at ISU where most students would say otherwise...keep in mind who \"most students\" are.

I feel this is because you have chosen what you love to do and these professors also love this subject--hence you get along. With this knowledge in mind, I feel like ISU has a great bunch of professors. This area is a great place to raise a family, so ISU gets some professors that have worked at much larger, more well-known, universities because the professor wanted to raise a family here.

I can't verify all students' obviously but I do know the ones that I have talked to and I can honestly say that I spend a great deal of time studying. \r\n\r\nAll of the classes that I have been in there has been a great deal of class particitpation. I believe that the majority of the people in that classes that I am in are involved a great deal in class discussion. \r\n\r\nCompetitive students however, are hard to come by, at least in my experience. I am exremely competitive but it seems that competitivness depends on where the student is in his or her life. \r\n\r\nThe most unique class that I have taken was childhood development. It was an extremely challenging class that pushed students to their utmost potential and discussed the ways in which individuals learn. It talked about why adolescents might do what they do and think the way that they do and that was by far the most interesting and unique class that I have taken.\r\n\r\nMy major is nursing. However, I have decided that I want to double major in not only nursing but psychology. \r\n\r\nI have spent some time in touch with class instructors outside of class and in office meetings discussing assignments.\r\n\r\nMy belief in this schools academic requirements are high. Every class that I have taken has been challenging and I think that if a student was determined to get a good grade that sufficient effort needed to be put fourth in order to achieve the goal.\r\n\r\nJobs after the education at this instituation are geared towards getting a job.

I discovered pretty quickly i'd have to change pace and really start to buckle down and study hard.  Microeconomics was especially a challenging course for me and i hated it at first, but once i started to grasp the concepts of supply and demand and listen intently in class i started to enjoy the course.  My professor was extremely passionate about economics and i think this also inspired some of my liking in the subject.

But if you do not like it you can always go out with some friends and have a really nice dinner at any close restaurant from campus. I usually hang put with my teammates.",

There are homecoming events, midterms and finals study sessions with free dinner provided (usually pizza), guest speakers, quad parties, lots of free food events, and free movies at the Bengal theatre. There are also many religious activities to take part in for students of various faiths including, LDS, Catholicism, and different branches of Christianity.\r\n\r\nFraternities, Sororities aren't overly focused on. Sports are a part of college life but not nearly as important as they are at other universities. There are however, many outdoor activities. \r\n\r\nWhile drinking isn't too big at Idaho State University there are many Student organized events for students to participate in.",

If that isn't enough for you there are several Clubs on campus there are clubs for theater, sewing, major oriented, and honor societies. You can't get board unless you want to!\r\n\r\nThe campus has places for studying, and meeting. Most students meet  potential partners in class and then meet for lunch in the cafeteria or study groups. \r\n\r\nI am the President of a club and I like to set up live speaker events so students can meet influential people in the community and start networking for when they graduate."

                "Megan": "My classes are demanding but I love them. I love learning. And I firmly believe in order to be a successful student at any university, you have to be willing to open your mind and try to learn as much as you can about every subject you take, even if your'e not interested.",
                "Elaine": "This is probably a harder question to answer. Why? Because every class is different. You have your general classes: impossible to define because all those teachers are different and the subject matter is different. You have your major classes: challenging but inevitably fun, because admit it, you love what you are studying, even if it is stressful and makes you want to through your hair out sometimes. And you have you fun classes (if you decide to take some): they just make your day because it is unstressful and completely unrelated to anything that is stressful.\r\n\r\nSo what are my classes like? They are incredibly worth it. I guess that would be the simple answer. You are learning...filling your brain with material that you will use for the rest of your life (unlike the feeling you sometimes got it high school). Some classes are more challenging, but you soon realize these are the ones that make you grow the most. And some classes just make you smile. ",
                "Sheena": "Don't get me wrong, they are challenging, but they don't stress you in into the emergency room. I have great professors and they try hard to keep the information up to date and interesting. They love the subject matter and they want to pass that on to us. The professors are always available to help you and if they aren't other professors want to know because ISU wants each student to suceed.\r\n\r\nSometimes students feel like they get overloaded but we have access to career counseling, personal counseling, academic advising and health services right there on campus. These people are amazing and they are there to help you."

See my response to this in the question, \"What is your overall opinion of this school?\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing that people complain about is our president. However, we also had complaints about, I believe, the past two presidents. Just like the president of the United States, when tough economic times hit, people get angry. The target of this anger is most likely whoever is in charge. It is a tough job, being the president of anything. I think that he is doing his best. I don't agree with everything he does, but I wouldn't expect that I would. A fun little fact that most students don't site: last year the Idaho Board of Education gave him a raise. One can't really deny the raise when everyone else is getting it. So, he took it--turned around and made a scholarship out of it. Looks like he is a real jerk? Anyways, I like to give him a smile when I see him around campus, because I know he needs a smile, and then go back to being angry at the real problem: the US government."

This school is very good academically level, all teachers are really engaged in your personal development as a person and as a professional,  but that is not it. It's installations for sports are very nice and in very good state. It is located in Pocatello, Idaho, close to many places you can visit like lava hot springs, Salt lake, Idaho falls, Boise etc.",

The school is just big enough where you can meet new people in new classes, but not too big where you never see them around campus so I think it's a good mix.  We have a lot of school spirit and like to go and cheer at basketball and football games.  Also, we have a ton of international students like many from eastern Asia, France and Germany, and from the middle east.  It's fun to get to meet people from different parts of the world and learn about their cultures first hand.  ",
                "Elaine": "One of the top reasons I decided to go to ISU was the class size. It is a perfect fit for those who want more individual attention. While some of the 100 level classes are larger, once you get into the under division courses, the class size goes down and you start get to know the people in your major very well. It makes learning easier because you can always find help with familiar faces and the professors. The one thing that I wish would change is our \u201ccollege town\u201d status.  Most people would not consider this town very \u201ccollege-town\u201d like. However, the current Mayor, Brian Blad, is working hard to break down what he calls the Invisible Wall that separates the university from the community. He has had some success so far, and I expect to see more in the coming years.",

With a small school size you'd expect to have more student/faculty interaction but the teachers seem just as absent-minded, the administration just as unresponsive, and the services provided just as low as a huge school with huge student populations.  We recently had a change in the schools presidency per the huge dissatisfaction by the faculty, however the scars of the past regime are still visible all around campus.  High prices for all services and charges for nearly every service imaginable make it seem like this is more a business than a school.  The major issue is unresponsiveness to the students needs and this has been my experience since enrolling in 2008.  In light of this in the spirit of Thanksgiving I am greatful for the surrounding community; ISU offers a unique experience to be within 3hrs of anywhere in the Northwest. So if you are into the outdoors this is a great place to be",
                "Julianne": "Idaho State University is great! Like every school, it has its flaws (dealing with the administration can be a nightmare), but on the whole it is wonderful. It's many attributes include a mini on campus Starbucks and Jamba Juice, a movie theatre that is free for students, and a super inexpensive (and often free) health clinic with a kind and caring group of medical professionals (ask for Dr. Solbrig).\r\n\r\nThe gym is very nice. A new work out room that connects to the gym was just completed. It has new equipment (some cardio machines even have cable TV) and the walls are covered in large windows. There is also a very big, extreme indoor rock climbing wall.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice new dorm rooms (in the Rendezvous building) with a very large common study area that connects to several halls of classrooms, the Starbucks, a little store, a grill and other food stations. \r\n\r\nThere are many outdoorsy things to do. Through the outdoor adventure center students can do such things as canoeing, camping, rock climbing, horseback riding and more. It also has a challenge ropes course, where students can climb tall towers and take a ride in the giant swing.\r\n\r\nThe forests and lakes are just a few minutes away from campus, and the weather is wonderful. The summer temperatures get up into the 90's, the fall colors are gorgeous and the campus is beautiful after the first winter snow storm (which usually doesn't yield more than a few feet of snow).\r\n\r\nBut the best thing about this school is definitely the fact that while it is a university, it doesn't have a gigantic campus. Unless you have a class in the gorgeous theatre building on the hill, you will almost certainly be able to walk to all your classes.\r\n",

There is also a lot of work but always a lot of fun. \r\n\r\nWe are working on adding even more classes to the Idaho Falls campus and we are really excited about that. The administration of the Idaho Falls campus and those in Pocatello that I have met are all awesome!

I spent most of my high school years being pent up in my room or my house. Go to your Senior Prom, or at least hang out with your friends since they didn't go. I'd also tell me to do things I could put on a resume. Do some volunteer work or join a club. It sounds exhausting, I know, but trust me it will be worth it when you have to write up your resume. I know being productive is the last thing you feel like doing, but apply for as many scholarships as you can. Graduating early was one of the best decisions you'll make.

I was lucky to get it corrected before I missed one of the classes.  I will definitely tell anyone I know that is starting their first year of college to make sure they do these two things.

The money value is helpful, but I find it even more beneficial to know how to expose myself, work hard, and go out of my way to find  information and help that I need to continue my education at the college level. Another piece of advice I would give myself would be to work extra hard my first year of college. I had expectations for myself, but I never knew that I could exceed my own expectations.

Now that I am in college, I am finding it difficult to learn many of the social skills or overcome the social insecurities that others shed in their high school years. I would have joined more clubs, ate lunch instead of studied and maybe skipped a few weekend dance classes to hang out with the friends I did manage to make.

It takes dedication because once you are released from class you still have work to do, you can't just go home and crawl back into bed.You have to work at it year around, making sure everything is ready for the next semester you will be attending. Hard work because you have a major goal you are working towards and striving to achieve, even though you know you have another four, five, or maybe even more years before you are finished here.

I got out of my very small community and attended school and actually was able to see issue's that were going on in the world and how different opinions really were.  Attending college has been a great opportunity to find out who I really am.  I feel like I started out with no identity and, though I have definitely made mistakes,  have finally figured out who I am and what I want to be.  I believe college has helped me believe this.\nI also have realized how important an education is.  I grew up in a home where my parents had very little education past high school.  There were times where things were tight and I could see the stress on my parents faces.  I knew I wanted to do something more with my life and have a better life for me and my future family.  It took me a little while to figure out what I want to do, but I am now motivated and ready to exceed in my career.",

Throughout the time I have been in college this professor has been with me from the beginning helping me along the way, and encouraging me more than my own family has. She is the reason I am bettering my life, and my education. She has helped me see that I am better than I was before, and no matter what as long as I have the drive to do something I can get it done. She is an inspiration to me, and I just hope one day I can accomplish what she has.",

The classes are a struggle and the homework just bearable.  However, every time I go to class I feel as if I am bettering my life.  With the bleak economy lurking all around me, my future seems uncertain.  Then I think about all of the work I have been doing for college and I feel a sense of pride and hope.  My college experience has given me a sense of well-being.  It has gave me hope for the future and assurance for my present decisions.  I have gained friends and knowledge and a greater appreciation for hard work and the value of money.  My advisors at school have made me feel like I am not just another number.

Even though all this seems good, I am still struggling financially to fulfill my aspirations. At times I just sit down and feel like I can't get a break but even when I think I can't do it anymore, I force myself to still push on because I know that the roughest roads often lead to the top. In my college classes there are people who are twice, even three times my age. So I tell myself, that if after all these years they are still doing it, I can to. College has been so valuable to attend because without a college education I know I am nothing. College has taught me that nothing will ever be handed to me and that no one said it would be easy, they only promised that it's be worth it.",

Through studying psychology I learned about the connection between my mind and body and was able to overcome an excruciating back injury and move myself to pursue dance as well. Through this discovery of my love for dance and body movement I came to realize that I can help children discover passions that will get them through emotional and physical hardships.

I have learned that there are so many understanding, caring, and passionate people here at ISU-faculty, students, and staff. I consider my experience here at Idaho State University extremely valuable. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. I came here as an 18 year old girl who was nervous to make her own way in the world, and already, 6 months later, I have found who I am.

But I would tell myself that college can be a lot of fun if I let it, and that I should allow myself to be more social and make more friends. College isn't just about academics; there are a lot of social activities, too, and while I would never tell myself that I should let my social life overwhelm my academic life, there is a balance to be obtained there that I think I let myself slack off on. I would tell myself that I don't have to worry, I really can do it.",

I would let myself know that that job wasn't worth missing school for, the traveling was fun, educational in a way-quite the learning experience,  but nothing can make up for that time I lost, that I could be so much farther than I am now. The reason I say \"be a bum\" (using that as a slang term I suppose) is that my parents were willing to support me to get me through college. But in an effort to have more, make more, and make it fast all on my own, I compromised my own schooling. So, to myself, take time, be more attentive, let the parents help. I never thought that I'd be stuck, but that is what I feel like. Note to self, you're still going to make it, just know that if you take this advice you'll like the outcome better.",
                "William ": "Everyone has a moment in time they would enjoy going back and revisiting, whether it be to change the past or just to relive it.  If I had a chance to go back and tell myself as a high school senior what I know about college and the transition I was about to make, I would be sure to include some great advice.  I would let myself know that to succeed I need to stay focused and that the transition really isn?t that bad, so quit worrying about it.  I would tell myself that to be who I want to become, I need to stay who I am, work hard, and with a little bit of talent and luck I can be anything I want! I would also tell myself to enjoy and take advantage of every opportunity to lean and discover something new that I come across.   Finally I would say that college life is going to be some of the best days in your life, so be sure to not let anything get you down, make friends, and save time for some fun, because it is the best way to succeed!"

One smart thing they did when they designed this building was making little cubbyholes that are about as big as a pretty fantastic walk in closet. Talk about a quiet place to study or have meetings! The best part it is first come, first serve\u2014 meaning no reservations! Just come and grab one first! However, if you do want a guaranteed place, you can reserve places at the library.

The parking lot doesn't have a lot of spots to fill but yet ISU sells a lot of parking passes.  When you go and try to park on campus you have a hard time looking for a parking place because there are more cars then spots.  The campus housing is bad.  Whenever you go into an apartment complex you have something that isn't working.  The food is not good and so you buy the meal plan and it goes to waist.",

The professors, the classes, the student programs, the library, the Student Union, the campus, the students - they are all terrific. OK, I have thought of one thing. The dance program was very amateur. There were no advanced classes, and the only dance company was made up of beginners.

                "Comment": "Illinois Central College is a two-year community college that helped me save money due to the cheap classes they provide. The campuses are clean and spacious making places like the library perfect for studying or working on projects. Campuses are spread out though so it will take some distance reaching one campus to the next. Classes are relatively cheap and are available in the mornings, evenings, and are even provided online making class schedules flexible for the student. There are a variety of programs so that students can explore the variety of majors they could take in the future. Teachers and staff are friendly and will offer any assistance to help a student reach their goal. However, the staff can sometimes be unreliable when answering questions or give information so students needs to look out for that. Getting help online can be extremely difficult considering some instructors take time answering questions by email and sometimes won't respond to it at all. Overall, if you're a student that lives in Illinois and aren\u2019t sure about your major, or are looking for cheap classes to get general eds out of the way I highly recommend ICC."

There are both great and not so great professors, but the ones that are helpful will go out of their way to help you succeed. The advisors seem to not keep up with current information and the courses needed to complete your degree. You need to do a lot of your own work to make sure that you are on track to graduate. Overall though, I recommend it if you're unsure of what you want to do or if you know the exact school you wish to transfer to. It's cheap and if you do your research on the professors you will have a great experience. "

Not only did I save money by attending a community college but I got certain classes out of the way and learned that I wanted to be a Child Life Specialist. Although, ICC did not have the major I was seeking, I was still able to take classes that would count and transfer when I go on to attend Illinois State University in Fall of 2020. I love the connivence of the small classrooms and I love how close everything is to each other. Going to ICC  saved me lots of money and steered me in the right path of what I wanted to major in. "

It is exciting to look into the unknown and know that you can be a voice for the future.\nSecond, suppress your ego.  I do not expect you to give up in striving for excellence, yet concentrate on where you focus your goals.  Do some soul searching and discover what make you \u201ctick\u201d.  Trying to fit in will make you \u201ccool\u201d, but being around people who don\u2019t understand you can make you feel alone.  In searching for yourself, be you and do what makes you feel fulfilled. You will find what values you hold dear and will defend.  It will give your life a sense of purpose and meaning. \nRemember the card you carry.  \u201cYour presence is a present to the world.\u201d  Make sure you have a voice, and that it is heard.

High school seniors often visit many universities to try to get a feel for where they would like to go, but a visit in itself is not enough preparation.  If I could go back and talk to myself when I was a senior, I would have told myself to try harder for scholarships, and not just go with the cheapest school. I would have also told myself to prepare for being away from my closest friends and family, because it is a lot harder than you think.

One adjustment I had to make to how I viewed my peers was that every single person on campus has a different worldview. I would tell myself that if I respect everyone for their worldview, I will receive respect in return. In terms of my schoolwork, I would tell myself that since I have already made a financial investment in my education, I should invest my best efforts in my work, and I will get out of a class what I put into it.

As a small, liberal arts college, there is plenty of opportunity to change the campus because of how you can develop close relationships with the faculty, staff, and administrators. Having faculty, staff, and administrators as accessible as they are at Illinois College allows students to know that they will be heard and are cared about. The faculty at Illinois College are spectacular, and go out of their way to ensure that their students are able to further their passion for whatever subject they are studying. Research opportunities, internships, and study abroad trips are part of the typical experience for a student at Illinois College which helps us solidify our love for what we are studying. The environment of Illinois College fosters love for whatever academic subject you like while making sure that you enjoy living on campus. "

The students are also very friendly and you can always have an interesting conversation.  The cafeteria food is not the best but you can always go to Mondos for a sub or Starbucks for a nice drink. The classes are challenging and there are a select few professors that are not the best at teaching but through my experience, all the professors on campus are more than happy to explain topics to you during their office hours or just have a nice chit-chat."

There are options to live in on campus houses and apartments also. Jacksonville is a short drive to Springfield so there is a lot of places to shop and a lot of things to do. Besides that therr is apways something going on, on campus. The food is decent and there are 3 differnt places ti eat on campus. The breakfast is the best! When it comes to the classes they are small my largest class was 20 students. This gives students and professors  the option to get to onow each other. I have been to 3 different colleges and Illinois College is by far my favorite."

The money they should be using on improvements usually goes to unnecessary programs, such as a gaming room. The food has, literally, been found to be unhealthy and uneatable. The food is either too strange to consume, or gives you gastric problems afterwards. They claim to be huge promoters of diversity, but it seems hypocritical. There is not much diversity in campus nor support for those who are diverse. "

The teachers are very helpful and the counselors are always available to help students out when they need it. Illinois College succeeded my expectations by a long shot, the classroom sizes are great they are small so that way the professors get to know everyone in their classroom. There are also many activities to participate in to keep you busy during the weekend and everything is close to the campus!! I would highly recommend this college to anyone who is looking for a small campus and a great academic culture. "

All the faculty does is gossip about students rather than care about what the truth is. \"safe IC\" is crap and when I called about a suicidal friend the school told me to let them sleep in my room and pushed off the problem on me. um. I am a college student- not a mental health professional. I never know how or who to contact for help. Living conditions aren't great and really strict. rules are never known until you get fined. I am always on edge for the next time I might get in trouble for doing absolutely nothing. No one tells their honest opinion about it here and everything is fake for potential students. after your campus visit you will never talk to administration again because they don't care. the only outcome when you're sick is that you are pregnant because they don't want to spend any money on actual tests for your well being.

Most students spend a lot of time studying. Some weeks you have a few tests, so you spend more time that week studying and doing homework. The next week you may only have a quiz or two and a paper, so you may have a little more free time. Most students will have about four classes and usually study for an hour or two each night for the class. Students can be competitive here, but are always willing to help each other study. The professors are very understanding. Some will give paper extensions if you have a reasonable excuse to why you need more time. Most will also let you make up a quiz if you are sick. At IC, we have free tutoring in most subjects. They harder you work, the better you do.",
                "Amibeth": "Being a liberal arts college, students are required to take several classes outside of you major. This is to help broaden your understanding and learning capacity. Some students take these classes as blow off classes, but your effort in the class reflects in your grade. The professor make the classes so that if you stay on top of your work and put an effort into learning the material, you will do fine in the class. IC does not have any \"weeding out classes.\" The introduction classes to Biology or Chemistry are the larges classes, with a maximum of 80 students, however the classes meet once a week for a lab time and the maximum for a lab is 20 students. So, even in these classes the professors make an effort to get to know the students on a personal and academic level. \r\nAnother great benefit of being a liberal arts college is that it forces you to expand your knowledge. One of the requirements is two semesters of a language. I started taking beginners German, never learning anything beforehand and now am majoring in German. This happens more often then most people think. So, if you are not sure what you want to study, come with an appetite for learning and an effort to apply yourself and IC will follow through with an abundance of knowledge.   ",
                "Alyson": "Academics at Illinois College are very personal. Professors know you by your name rather than a number in the grade book. Classes average 18-20 students with a few beginning lecture classes topping off at 75 students. That is the biggest any class on campus will be. In fact, many classes fall below the average size which allows for more one on one time with the professor. With such small classes, majority of the classes are discussion based. It is not very often that a professor just lectures the entire class. Instead, the professors want to get the students involved in the class. One thing I really love about Illinois College is the general education requirements. While some students see this as a hassle and a waste of time, it has really helped me find my way toward the right major. The general education requirements require you to take at least one class in each field of study. This is beneficial for those students who still do not really know what they want to study in college. This way, you get a basic knowledge for the different fields and can hopefully have a better understanding of what will suit you best. ",
                "Amy": "Being a small school, you have the oppertunity to get to know your classmates and as well as your professors getting to you!  You begin to look up to those around you, and learn to trust in one another.  Illinois College is a liberal arts so which means you have an oppertunity to take a wide range of classes and experience something you may not have had the chance to otherwise.  I plan on majoring in elementary education and one thing I love the most about Illinois College is that you get to dive right in your freshman year.  You're able to go out into the schools and tutor those kids who need a little extra oomph!  One on one attention helps drastically when a child is struggling.  The requirements at Illinois College aren't impossible by any means.  They just allow to become fully qualified in the area you plan on majoring in.  The education at IC is one you will forever be grateful towards.",
                "Katie": "I feel like all of the professors want to do their best at trying to know all of their students on a personal level. My favorite professor and class so far is my first year seminar Women of the American West with Jenny Barker-Devine. She is a wonderful professor, and really loves getting to know her students. I have her as a friend on Facebook! We have taken a few fieldtrips, and I feel like she really wants us to get hands-on experiences. Class participation seems very common at IC. The education department is very well known, and a lot of companies are willing to hire someone majoring in education at IC. It is a very rigorous schedule, but well worth it in the end.",
                "Joshua": "The professors at IC are extremely approachable and available to students.  They have reasonable expectations for their students and push them to set and exceed goals.  Most professors classes revolve around student participation and reflection, and the educational experience is definitely geared towards learning how to apply classroom topics to real world problems or goals.  It is common to see professors on campus and in the community, and most professors will recognize students for the remainder of their college career.",
                "Ross": "All of my professors know my name, what I do on campus, and where I want to go after college. They show up to my concerts, sporting events, and other functions. My favorite class thus far has been mass communication, because it has showed me how much the media affects our daily lives. Music theory and music history are a pain in the butt. Class participation is in fact part of my grade in most courses. The professors want to make sure that you are engaged and understanding the material being presented because it is relevant. I have had many deep conversations about class materials over lunch or during a passing period. Students are extremely competitive, especially when trying to get into prestigious classes and internships. Education at Illinois College will indeed prepare you for the workplace, but it will also aid you in finding the person you want to be.",
                "Claire": "Since Illinois College is a small school the teacher to student ratio is also small. Every single one of my teachers has known my name either before I walked into the classroom or within the first week of school. The professors are there to help support you in your learning, not to make you feel inadequate in the classroom. My professors have office hours and love to have students come and talk about whats going on in the class or even their lives. I have went to my professors offices many times to discuss things about whats going on in my life or what I wanted to be doing after I graduate from Illinois College. Overall the classes are small, with maybe up to 30 students on average in a class, with professors who care an want to see you succeed. "

            "What are the most popular student activities/groups?  ": {
                "David": "Some of the most popular groups to join have been Literary Societies (our Greek organizations), Alpha Phi Omega (Co-ed service fraternity), and Homecoming Committee. Athletics are also big here. You can do varsity or Intramural Sports. I play on intramural volleyball and basketball teams. I am a member of the Peer Health Educators here at IC. We present entertaining programs and activities to educate the campus on how to be safe and healthy. We have presented many different programs including Beer Goggle Golf Carts and Think B4 You Act. Think B4 You Act was awarded Outstanding Freshman Orientation Program by the BACCHUS Network at the 2010 BACCHUS General Assembly. On the weekends a lot of students go to events planned by the Student Activities Board, or take part in other activities sponsored by other groups. These are free and are alcohol free. Most of us take random trips to Wal-mart or go out to eat on the weekends or just hang out in our rooms. ",
                "Amibeth": "Considering that we have about 150 guys on the football team, that is what I would consider the most popular organization, but there are plenty of other organizations on campus. There are over 70 different clubs on campus, all varying in their time commitment. If you are looking for a group to invest a lot of time an effort, there are clubs like Student Activity Board (which plans all of the events on campus) or writing for the school newspaper, the Rambler. Or you could be involved in clubs that meet only once a week or twice a week and maybe have one or two events each semester. \r\nOne of the nice things about IC is that there are enough events going on that do not requiring drinking as an activity. SAB provides entertainment most weekends, so that students don't have to drink. Also, it is easy to find a group of friends who also don't drink and have movie parties with them on the weekends. Sometimes we will take road trips to Springfield, which is about 20 minutes away, to go to the mall or go out to eat at different restaurants. Jacksonville has about every fast-food restaurant imaginable, which are fun places to go at 2 am, but Springfield has options for different food options. \r\nThe town of Jacksonville, although small, also provides some entertainment on weekends. There is a bowling ally, two movie theaters, great Mom and Pop restaurants and fun communal activities. ",
                "Alyson": "There are many popular student groups on campus such as Alpha Phi Omega, Up til Dawn, Circle K International, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Brother and Sisters in Christ, just to name a few. This is something I love about Illinois College, There are so many ways to get involved that students do not sit around wondering what they should do. Instead, students often find themselves asking how much can I be involved with. I am constantly asking myself this question because I am already involved in a lot, yet there is so much more that I would like to be involved with. At Illinois College, you are sure to find your \"home.\"",
                "Amy": "There are so many activites on campus - and trust me when I say this - but if you can't find the one you want, create it yourself.  Many people are sure to follow you and join in.  From all the organications to clubs to intramural sports teams, your'e sure to find the right activity for you.  When it comes to dorm life, almost everyone is sure to leave their door open.  This allows you to meet so many people and make so many friends.  We so not have any fraternities/sororities but we do have literary societies which are similar but more geared toward making the right decisions.  You can always find something to do here.  Life at Illinois College is amazing.",
                "Katie": "My first piece of advice is LEAVE YOUR DOOR OPEN WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR ROOM! I know a lot of my friends say that no one leaves their door open and it's so quiet on their floor and doesn't feel very inviting. Obviously if you're studying really hard or just want a little bit of  quiet time, close your door, but otherwise, be inviting! I am in FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes), and I love it. I would highly recommend joining that. Also, try to get an on-campus job. It's great experience to have a job anyway, but to have one on campus is a plus. I am also playing softball, and already the oder girls are so sweet and inviting, and I feel like we're a family already. If you're unsure about playing a sport, try it! I met a lot of my close friends either through sports or just trying to be social on my floor. I also met one of my closest friends at Orientation before school even started, so even if you're shy like I am, try to be outgoing because everyone is in your position.",
                "Joshua": "I would not say that any particular activity at IC is more popular than another.  With 70 different student organizations, there is really something for everyone.  It is very easy to become involved in activities on campus, and these activities play a large put in determining a student's  college experience on IC's campus.",
                "Ross": "A very large percentage of our student body are athletes. Our football and baseball teams are most popular, followed by soccer and track and field. I play football and swim. I am also in three choirs on campus, which are popular on the extracurricular spectrum as well. In most of the freshmen dorms, your door is open if you're there, and rarely locked. That's where life-long friends are made. You'll eat together, hang out together, whatever. Weekends are good for spending time together watching movies and staying up late for no reason at all.",
                "Claire": "There are over 80 different organization groups to pick from on campus. This means that almost every single weekend there is something to do on or off campus. There are many different trips and activities that groups plan off campus. Yet, there are even more planned right on campus that are free to students. I have enjoyed different activities such as capture the flag on the quad all the way to an awesome mime performance in the theater. Something unique to IC is a tradition of Literary Societies, who put on literary productions through out the year. Whatever you are interested in there is a group for you, and if there isn't IC encourages starting new student groups all the time. "

            "What are your classes like? ": {
                "Alyson": "The classes at Illinois College are really a unique experience. The normal class size is 18-20 students. This allows you to have the one on one time with your professors, which is crucial to success. The professors get to know you as a person, and you are known by your name, not a number as it would be at much larger schools. ",
                "Amibeth": "Some students may find one-on-one interaction with a professor intimidating, and it can be, but the professors at Illinois College really know what they are talking about, have a passion for what they are doing, and strive to see that their students understand the material. You as a student, however, are responsible for your own homework, staying on top of the work, and making an effort to get help when you know things aren't going well. \r\nThe class load varies from class to class. Some classes are writing or reading intense, while others don't have any \"assigned homework.\" But, if you keep up with the material, come to class prepared, and work hard, there is no reason for the professor to not love you. \r\nAs for class sizes, the largest class we have at IC is with about 80 students max and those classes are the introduction classes (like Biology, Chemistry, and Sociology). Despite being in a lecture hall with 79 other students, you spend one day a week with 20 other students in lab, getting to know a small portion of your class and your professor. The other classes at IC range from 20 students to 1. It is not uncommon to have only a couple other students in a class, especially in the upper level classes. This allows for a more intimate learning experience where the professor can specialize the class to fit your needs.",
                "Katie": "So far in my first semester of college, my classes have been pretty easy. There is a transition coming to college on the amount of study time, but thankfully I have not had too many problems adjusting. I know as I progress, things will be more difficult though.",
                "Ross": "Classes can be challenging, no matter the subject area, but they all make you a better person. You learn new perspectives, techniques, and mannerisms that will aid you in life in general. Even my general education courses were beneficial."

They also know what I hope to accomplish while I'm here, and what my future plans are. Everyone here is very supportive of each student. I love having a small class size, most of classes have about 20-25 students in it. Campus really comes alive when there is a game. Everyone is wearing there IC gear and heading out to the game to have a good time.  ",
                "Amibeth": "One of the reasons that I picked IC was that it was a small school with an atmosphere of closeness. Its a good size school because as you walk from class you say hello to people you know, but it is big enough that you meet someone new everyday. \r\nAnother great benefit of IC are the professors. The adjustment to college and to college level classes are hard, but the professors do a great job of preparing you and helping you to adjust. As a requirement of the school, every professor has office hours which are specific times in the week, when the professor will be in his or her office waiting for students to come by with questions. Also, most professors will go out of their way to help a student understand a concept, make up missed work, or provide wisdom for impending decisions about the future. \r\nWhat helped me adjust quickly to college was the required First-Year seminar. Every first-year student is required to take one of these classes. The student will be in a class with 15-20 other first-year students and the professor becomes their advisor to help them with the first few semesters or until the students declare a major. A summer reading is required that helps tie all of the seminars together. My first-year seminar was a great introductory class because my professor expected a lot out of us and pushed us to excel, but once the class was over we knew what we could do, and nothing after that seems too daunting. Because of this I know that I can succeed in whatever I put effort in. \r\nThe closeness of the professors also leads to many open opportunities to be involved in activities that would not be open to first-year students or even undergraduate students. At IC I have been able to try different activities such as going to Berlin over spring break and Michigan over fall break, all through classes. ",
                "Alyson": "My overall opinion of Illinois College is that I would not trade it for any other school. Since the first time I stepped on the campus for an open house, I have constantly been amazed at the amount of camaraderie that is found on campus. The students, faculty, and staff truly care about each other. I believe this stems from the relatively small size of the college. Illinois College has roughly 1,000 students, which may seem too small to some people, but once on the campus, it is easy to realize that it is the perfect size. At Illinois College, students are known on a first name basis with their professors; we are not a huge university where students are known as numbers. Students at IC form personal relationships with almost everyone they meet. Although we lack the high profile sports events that are found at universities, are campus still has a lot of pride in the athletes that represent Illinois College. Overall, students do not come here to play sports; they come here to get an outstanding education and the sports are just a part of that journey. The campus truly is the perfect environment for successful learning.",

This place provides the type of atmosphere where you can't help but feel wanted!  It's a small school, so everyone has the oppertunity to connect to those around them! Both the staff and the students are so friendly.  I remember the first time I visited this campus - I didn't walk by one person who didn't smile at me or ask how my day was!  It's a place you can call home and be proud to brag about!",
                "Katie": "I absolutely love the size of IC. I went into my college search looking for a smaller school, and fell in love with IC. It's easy to talk to your professors one on one and the class sizes are perfect. The one thing I would change would be the food. I understand it isn't cheap feeding an entire campus of students, but I feel like the food could be much better. I also wish there was a Pep Band at sporting events and more of an organized student section. Jacksonville is also a great town and there is enough to do without it being too big.",
                "Claire": "Illinois College is a small school that has a feeling of being at home. Many of the students would say that the best thing about IC is that it is like one big family, I would definiently have to agree with that statement. This is my 4th year at IC and I have always felt like there were people on campus to support me in anything I was doing. From the professors in the classroom to the other students in your dorms and classes you will always have someone you know around. The fact that we are a small school allows us to have connections with almost everyone on campus.\r\nAnother great thing about school is that you can be involved in many different organizations. Since there are only about 1,000 students at the school they  need students to be involved in many different activities. You are able to be involved as a basic member or even on take on leadership roles in any of the 80+ activities that IC has to offer.\r\nOverall IC is a great small school that helps to get you connected inside and outside the classroom.

It's also okay to miss home, to visit home, or to cry about it. I would also encourage myself by saying,  the best part of college is the people you meet and the friends you make. The friends you make in college are the ones you have for the rest of your life. You do so much growing up together in such a short time. Don't be in a hurry to grow up either,  you should enjoy every minute. This truely is the best time of your life, so don't let it pass you by. Take every oppurtunity.

You are with the same people from the time you start kindergarten all the way through high school, take college as the opportunity to go somewhere new, to meet new people and to figure out what difference you want to make in the world.  It is intimidating at first to be in a place where you don't know a soul, but start with your roommate, get to know her and then start joining various activities around school.  Illinois College is small, get to know as many people as possible and don't be constrained by the thought that they don't know you--how are they ever going to know you if you don't go out there to meet them?  There are a lot of good people in this world that you will miss if you aren't open to meeting them.  So be friendly, be social, and have fun.",
                "Samantha": "To be honest, I wouldnt change a thing.  The oppurtunities and memories that I have made have helped me become a stronger, more deicated, and inspired student. Without diversity and challanges how would you learn and grow?  I love my school and all that it has given to me.  I am proud to say I attend Illinois Collge.",
                "Jordan": "Stay focused. You know what you want to do. Don't let anyone slow you down or get in your way. Keep your eyes on your goals but don't forget to have fun. Get out and get involved as soon as you can. You'll love it. Meet everyone you can, you never know who could turn out to be a life-long friend.",

                "Marc": "Knowing what I know now about college life and making the transition, the first piece of advice to myself would be to become better prepared for your future. Expose yourself to information, and have a better understanding of what it takes to be a successful individual, as well as a student. Secondly, I would tell myself to never give up when facing adversity. Also, give your maximum effort in everything that you do and you will see success. Lastly, I would tell myself to relax. Don't become stressed over the unknown, but, if fact embrace it. This is what makes life exciting, embrace the change.",
                "matthew": "If I could go back in time to my Senior year in high school, I would tell my senior self to stop being a perfectionist. Throughout my high school years, I was a massive perfectionist. I always aimed for getting A's on everything or getting the top time in Track and Field. My bar was so high for myself that everytime I would fall short, I continuously punished myself. Being a perfectionist was robbing me of my peace and self esteem.\n         Even at the beginning of college,  my perfectionism was still kicking my butt. I felt like I had to get a 4.0 G.P.A. It even got so terrible that when my friends were joking around with me on my flaws (like my running form), I felt I was worthless because I was not perfect. \n         I decided one day that I was done being a perfectionist, so I seeked help from the college counselor. He gave me some tactics about dealing with perfectionism, and I even went as far as reading about it myself. Soon, I was able to relax more and cope with making mistakes because I learned that nobody is perfect.",
                "Michael": "If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to work harder for better grades. I could make the grades, but didn't push myself to go above and beyond. I would have spent more time studying rather than just getting by, because now I see the financial burden I have put on my parents for getting those average grades and not the grades that I was very capable of receiving had I just applied myself. I would also have been more outgoing, although I played sports, I would have joined more clubs to get better awareness of just what a difference I could make in my life and someone else's. Illinois College pushes for community involvement and now looking back I wish I would have done more of that. My little brother is autistic, I should have done something in our community to bring awarenss to this disability as so many people don't understand why he acts like he does sometimes. He has been a blessing in my life and I just wish I would have shared that more with my friends.",
                "Holly": "I would tell myself to never lose that confidence I had in myself and my abilities that I had as a senior. I knew what I wanted in high school and I always worked to get it. I wish I would have kept that attitude because my freshman year, I slacked a little on my grades. It wasn't anything dramatic just not as good as I was used to getting. I know now that as long as you put in the effort and time you will get the results you want. I would also tell my younger self that it is okay to be an individual and stick out. I came into college wanting to fit in, but eventually found that being an individual is a lot more fun. People seem to follow your lead when you decide to be yourself and they realize how happy you are. They last thing I would tell myself, is that you only go to college once and then it's reality. Work hard on your school work, but don't forget to experience everything you can while you are there.",
                "Taylor": "My transition into college went surprisingly better than I expected.  I was nervous going to school three hours away from home because I am super close to my family, especially my twin sister.  We decided to go to different schools, which I think helped us both in many ways.  I was paired with a really awesome roommate. We became best friends with in the first few weeks of school.  Now that I am a senoir in college, honestly, I don't think there is anything I could have told myself that would have made the transition into college any better.  I was just really lucky.  I was from a small town and high school, so going to Illinois College was a good fit for me.  Everyone on campus is extremely nice and the professor are really helpful.  The only thing that I can think of that I wished I would have done as a freshman was actually take the time to get help from my professors.  All of my professors have been extremely nice and I wished I would have taken advantage of going to get help from them more often.",
                "timothy": "I would say that I need to be ready to study! As long as you show up to class and pay attention you will have no problem making grades in college!",
                "Christopher": "Scholarships.  Seek and apply now. Do not think that they are not out there. I have lost thousands of potential dollars by being unaware of Eagle Scout scholarships. Those are valuable, and along with others, will not be available beyond your first year. Many are easy, just filling out basic information and writing essays. Do them.  \nMajors. Wait to declare. Do not be like others going in with one decided major only to choose differently later. Such students often result with classes not applying towards the new major. Wait until you are absolutely sure what you want to do. It is worth it. \nExtracurriculars.  Join groups. They are a great way to meet people. Sigma Pi is the literary society to choose, but go to more \u201csmokers\u201d so you know more of the actives and brothers during the pledging process.  Also, do sports. Cross Country and Track are fantastic at Illinois College.\nLastly, I am glad I was recognized for six years of community service by our mayor, earned my Eagle Scout, participated in church groups, and worked for good grades. It is all worth it when you get here. It is the character you and your future stands on.",
                "Rudolph": "I would encourage and advise myself to get involved in lots of activities right off the bat.  It is the easiest way to find and meet new friends who have the same interests that you do. I started out quiet and shy like I was in high school, when I wish I had become more sociable. Remember that college is a chance to start over again and a chance to try all sorts of new things. I signed up for chorus and took voice lessons, something I would never have done in high school and I am so glad I did. I found that I really enjoy music and had the experience of taking a bus trip to New Orleans and performing in many places along the way! If I had not tried this new interest I would have missed a great time! I now intend to try anything I think I might enjoy.",
                "Jenna ": "I have learned a lot about current events, even though I am a science major. Before I started college here I had a very limited understanding of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but my freshman seminar class taught me that and much more. I have also made some great friends and met very interesting people. I know that what I have learned in my first semester will stay with me for the rest of my life.  So it has been a valuable experience so far and I know that I am just getting started.",
                "Mariah ": "Illinois College is a small college.  The fact that I have received such a great education from some of the best professors is really important to me.  In fact, it outweighs the fact that this is such a small school and can be boring at times.  The hunger for knowledge this school has given me is incredible.  I have always been a good student, but here I have to work to be a good student, and it is work I like doing.  I love forming relationships with students, professors, and even the president of the college who invites every student over to his house for dinner.  I have learned so much here and have had the opportunity to work with actual people and make actual differences both on and off campus.  It was the best decision I have ever made.",
                "Courtney ": "I have learned much about teaching children through my schooling at Illinois College.  I find the skills I have learned a great way for me to become a great teacher one day.   Even though the college is expensive to attend, I have great skills now to run my own classroom.  Also, I have made many lifelong friends.",
                "Cory ": "My college experience has strengthened me as an individual, and I feel as if I have matured greatly in the short two years of attending. For example, I had the unique experience of participating in a group that works with first generation students by preparing them for college; by having them come to campus a few weeks before the other students and doing core subjects with professors and college students. Transitioning from high school to college was rather difficult, but I endured the challenges that change presented and used it to better myself as an individual. College has changed me as a person, and I feel if this change keeps up then I will be ready to take on the world.  Attending college is crucial for anybody even considering getting a over minimum wage job, even though its hard  it will be well worth it once it is all done.",
                "Shelby ": "Although I have only been enrolled in college for one semester I have gotten a lot out of it. College has been a great experience so far. It is teaching me how to manage my time, and how to take care of myself. I feel that college is helping me become independent and is helping me gain the information I need to know to become successful. Coming to college has made me value my education more. It makes me feel accomplished being the first person in my immediate family to attend a four year university. I feel that my college experience will grow to be even more wonderful. It is molding me into the person I will become for the rest of my life. I can't wait to look back at my college experience and see how much I have grown.",
                "Andrea ": "From my college experience thus far I have learned to plan and live on my own away from my parents. In high school I didn't have to study much for any of my classes but this changed when I got to college. I have learned to study and prepare for tests. I've really enjoyed how friendly everyone is here on campus. I have been able to create relationships with my teachers because they are helpful with I have problems understanding the information they are teaching. Also the friends I have made here at college have made a very valuable impact on my experience. I know that these friends will be there for me whenever I need them.",
                "Alexander ": "If I were able to go back in time to my senior year in high school, there are a few things that I would tell myself to do to better prepare for college living. The first thing that I would say to myself is to be more on top of my homework. I feel that while academically I was very well prepared for the first semester, but I struggled to keep myself on top of my homework. That brings me to the second thing I would tell myself, to be more organized. I was a very unorganized student in high school, and making the transition from being unorganized to organized at the same time as adjusting to college living was difficult. I feel like if I had been more organized, I would have been more on top of my homework, and as a result gotten better grades. Those two things would be the most important things I would tell myself if I could go back and counsel my senior self.",
                "Amanda ": "I would tell myself that I need to work on organizing my area and time a lot more. Juggling sports and school and a social life is tuff. Knowing when things are do and when I have an event is very important for myself, to maintain all three things in my life.",
                "Julie ": "Illinois College spends a lot of time trying to open all of its students to different cultures and traditions. I feel that I have gained valuable insight to things I may have not otherwise experienced, like attending convocations and attending world culture events. Illinois College has a variety of lectures and activities that open up its students' minds to these things. After attending this college I have gained respect, knowledge and understanding of different world cultures, and I have had the opportunity to travel to different countries to immerse myself in their culture. Those experiences and newfound enlightenment are invaluable to me, and I know I will treasure them for the rest of my life.",
                "Liz ": "As I progress through my studies, I realize that my skills in communication, computers, group collaborations, and people skills have grown in magnitude.  With these, I can enrich society to embrace differences and learn to work together towards a common goal.  I was fortunate enough to participate in a BreakAway while earning my Bachelor's Degree.    After 10 weeks of study focused on associated literature, history, and sociological aspects, a mixed group of faculty and students spent a week in London, England, where we visited some of the most spectacular buildings and sites in the world.  Our campus contains visiting students from several foreign countries and encourages U.S. students to study or travel abroad by offering scholarships, grants, and opportunities through the Study Abroad and BreakAway programs.  Interaction with students from differing ethnicities or countries is emphasized through clubs and classes on-campus.  Globalization is spreading, and being able to cooperate and build friendships with other people from different backgrounds builds character and strengthens our global community.  Keeping this in mind, I stay in contact with friends who have graduated and moved back to their own countries to continue their studies.",
                "Sharon ": "I started college when I had come to a crossroads in my life. My husband and I divorced, and I had no real training that would lead to a fulfilling career. That first semester was so difficult for me, and I was afraid to even talk in class.\nI had an amazing oral communications professor that pushed me to come out of my shell. With her encouragement and inspiration I began to speak in public and talked more in classes every day. Always searching for new answers and no longer afraid to question even what was in our textbooks or happening in the world. Growing up with abuse, I always knew I wanted to find the reason behind the cycle of events. The advisors and professors helped me to decide on my major in psychology. Through the help I have received from the faculty and staff at college, I became more involved in our community and on campus. Through this involvement I have seen an even higher need for the help that I am aspiring to be able to confidently give. Without the college community, I would still be searching for answers for my own personal goals.",
                "Wilma ": "My college experience at the Lancaster Campus of Central Pennsylvania College has enriched my life in so many different ways. \nI've learned to listen to other peoples perspectives, to think outside the box, and to live by my own set of values and beliefs. I'm not so quick to believe everything I'm told, but to question things and search for the true answer.  I have learned that things I used to believe were impossible for me to learn, I can learn when I apply myself to my studies.  I have learned that when things are hard, if I reach way down inside myself, I am able to pull up the impossible. This experience alone, has helped to make me a confident and self assured person.  Knowing who I am as I enter the professional field is why my college experience has been valuable to me.  The friendships I've established with fellow students and professors has also brought value and meaning to my life.",
                "Alicia ": "Looking back now, my choice to become a Dual Enrollment student and attend college a year early was one of the best choies I could have made.  I allowed myself to \"broaden my horizons\" and take chances by meeting new people and challenging my abilities academically and personally.  College, in my opinion, is a symbol of hope.  Hope for more knowledge and more experiences.  I have learned to enjoy life and look forward to my future.  My college experience definitely changed my life for the better.  If more people were exposed to these opportunities, I am sure they would feel the same way.",
                "Dani ": "My time at Illinois College is full of invaluable experiences. One of my best decisions was to join a Literary Society, Sigma Phi Epsilon. I?ve held many offices and am currently serving as their President. These girls have become my family, and friends that will stick with me for the rest of my life.\nIn college I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. I stopped listening to what other people told me was \"practical\" and discovered what I really want.  I'm an activist, a feminist, and I care deeply about people and the issues surrounding them. After undergrad I plan to join the Peace Corps.\nI'm a Theatre major, which is something I never thought possible. I now know that I want to attain a higher degree and teach at the college level. Although I don?t know all the details yet, my life has a plan. \nIn my time in college I?ve figured out what I like and what I like to do, but most importantly I discovered who I was.",
                "Atiana ": "I have attend classes at my high school during dual enrollment and I feel that this experience has given me the chance to get to know myself better. I have had the opportunity to take some courses and find out some of my interests. This as allowed me to think about the major I want to have and degree I will earn. I have every intention to get a degree and graduate college. I am a hard working and dedicated student that will be the first one in my family to graduate college if my twin sister does not beat me to it. College is very important to me to be able to have a successful future. With a degree from college it would open doors to other opportunities and allow me to have a degree in something that I am passionate about. I believe that more people should attend college to have opportunities for a stable and successful future.",
                "Taylor ": "I have only attended college for a year but I have already gained so much from this experience.  To really understand what I have gained you have to know that I am twin.  My sister and I have been inseparable all of our life. In the fall of 2009, my sister and I set out for two different colleges that were two hours apart.  I learned a lot about my self this past year. I always felt that my sister was better at everything. When I got to college, I realized I was the only one comparing us.  I found courage in my self to just be the best me.  I also learned that I could stand on my own two feet.  My parents have been support all my life and though their love and support are just as strong, I found I can make my own decision for my self though the may not always be the best decision.  Most of all, I found out that I am a much stronger person than I ever thought I was.  To some this might not be a huge gain but to me, I feel I have gained everything.",
                "Nicole ": "Through my experience at Ivy Tech Community College, I have learned a great deal about time management, communication, and the value of learning. I have been continually challenged by the experience of a college environment, and I have developed perseverence in the face of hardships, exhaustion, and pressure. I have gained basic knowledge in a variety of subjects, but I also have learned much about people and life through my professors, faculty, and fellow students. As a human services student, I am learning practical skills, such as active listening, reflection, paraphrasing, summarizing, and more. I feel that I am being prepared to effectively support a diverse population of clients. Overall, college has been a rewarding experience.",
                "zachary ": "I have gotten out of my college experience that you have to work hard for what you want.  If you want it bad enough you will do whatever you have to do just to get it.   I had to work hard to get in to this college and i am really happy to be here i hop that I get to keep all of my friends and make more when I leave.",
                "Katie ": "I would tell myself that acquiring good study habits is detrimental to my college education.  Unfortunetly I did not develope good study habits in high school and that has made my college years harder than they should have been.   I would have motivated myself to take school seriously and in turn would have gained valuble learning skills that would have helped me a lot in college.  The second thing  is to be who I am.   Don't be who you think people want you to be.  If someone doesn't respect you for who you are or what you believe than you really don't need that person in your life.  When I was in high school I tried to please everyone and be apart of everything even if that meant me being unhappy.  When I got to college I soon found out that the ultimate goal out of life is to make myself happy and not worry about what others thought about me.  God brings the people into your life that are suppose to be there and I really learned that going away to college. But the number one thing I would tell myself is, Mom is ALWAYS right!",
                "Hannah ": "If I could go back in time to talk to myself about college life, I would advice myself to try my hardest and stay calm.  In college the only thing you can do is try your best. If you need academic help you should get  it through the available tutoring services because everyone including yourself wants you to succeed. I would also tell myself not to get too stressed about the little things. You have to stay calm, and take what comes to you with patience.  Nothing is given to you that you cannot handle; it may be difficult at times,  but keep trying and you will be successful.  The last piece of advice I would give myself is to value friendships.  Since your family is not there with you, you have to lean on friends and keep them close. Be the best friend you can and you will get support and love in return. Friends are your family when you are at school.",
                "Devin ": "The first thing that i would tell myelf is to create good study habits, because in college the studying is a vital part to your success.  Also, i would definitely advise myself to work on time management.  Time management is something that has to be dealt with every single day, and it is essential that your time is managed well.  The last thing that i would advise myself to do is to develop better critical thinking and listening skills.  These skills are needed while in class, and are also needed outside of class when doing your homework or writing a paper.  There are lots of papers in college, and being able to think to get through them makes it a whole lot easier to accomplish.",
                "Corey ": "If I could go back in time before college and talk to myself as a high school senior there are a couple things that I would tell myself. First, I would tell myself to make sure I study for tests a little each night starting at least a week before the test. College isn't like high school and you can't cram the  night before and still expect to get an A. I would also tell myself to make sure you get out and meet people the first week that your at college cause if you wait to long everyone has already formed groups and it is harder to find friends.",
                "Hailie ": "I would tell myself to relax, and look forward to the first few weeks--they really fly by!  I was really nervous about having a randomly-selected roommate, but we ended up having a lot of things in common, and when it came to some of our differences, we've been flexible about letting each other be seperate people.  I've also realized that college offers more freedom socially than high school.  When I was younger, I was really shy in school, but lately, I have felt more free to express myself.  I think that before college started, I was very apprehensive about all the changes in my life that would happen, but now I realize that these changes and how I've reacted to them have been an important part of who I am.  I hope that in the future, I can use this knowledge to relax and look forward to changes in my life.  Because after all, I know what it's like to be the nervous freshman, but I also know what it takes to become a confident upperclassman.",
                "Stephanie ": "Make sure to do research on possible majors and what classes are offered under that major at schools you're looking at.   Be fexible, yet decisive.  It is okay to change your mind and major, but when it's time to be serious, do just that.  \nFocus on schoolwork at least half as much as social life.  They say that for every hour spent in class, two hours should be spent studying, BUT  it'sokay to spend less time as long as you allow more time when needed. \nFigure out your study habits early!  You write best under pressure, but be sure to get all other schoolwork done before the paper has to be written.\nLastly, this isn't high school.  It's okay to be 100% yourself.  People will like you for who you are.   Stand up for what you believe in or you'll fall for anything.",
                "Darren ": "Hey, Darren, I want to congratulate you on taking advantage of so much that your high school has to offer you:\n- Taking all of the honors/advanced classes that were offered;\n- Playing competitively in three different varsity sports;\n- Making wise choices in your electives;\n- Volunteering in causes that you believe in;\n- Establishing great friendships.\n\nNow, I'd like for you to stretch just a little more and consider taking on leadership roles like Student Government, a \nclass office, or president of one of your many organizations or clubs.  Leadership roles in high school will improve your \ncommunication skills (oral and written) and develop listening, delegation, time-management, organizational, and human relations skills. \n     I've been reading several professional publications recently and a common thread is regret at not having taken \nadvantage of the opportunity to develop leadership skills initially in high school and then further refining them in college.  \nProfessionals feel that a lack of skills in these areas have negatively impacted both their job satisfaction and success. \n     Keep up the great work, Darren!  You are going to be very proud of your efforts in high school!  And, please consider taking charge in an organization that you feel strongly about.",
                "Kelly ": "Don't get discourage about what other poeple say about you. Listen to what people say when they say that it gets better. you'll make new friends and enjoy school even more than you already do. Just bare with the rest of high school life.",
                "Christina ": "I would tell myself not to worry so much about the little things. College is tough but it makes you stronger and smarter in the end. Take the little chances to have fun in high school because once you get to college there's not much time for fun between studying and classes and work. When packing for dorm life, pack your bags and take only half of the things you think you will need. Dorms are much smaller than you would think. Move in day will be crazy and you will see many unfamiliar faces and a few familiar ones, just know that everyone is in the same boat with moving in and attempting to fit their whole life in a small shared room. When meeting your roommate say hello with a smile and treat her the way you would like to be treated. Last of all, have fun in your last year of high school, you'll never get the chance to go back, and during your first year of college, work hard, have fun, and stay out of trouble. Make the next four years count and have the time of your life.",
                "Annamarie ": "I would tell myself that there is a lot more freedom going to be coming your way, so make sure that you use your time wisely and get involved in things right away!  Academics are most definately your number one focus but you do need to have a social life as well, so have some fun every once in a while.  No matter how difficult classes or how homesick you may get... never, never give up! You can do anything you really want to do!",
                "EvaAnne ": "When I was a high school senior, I really didn't know what I wanted to do, but I was sure I was going to go to college.  I would tell myself to explore more career choices and figure out what I would do.  I did not prepare as I should have for my college studies.  In addition, I would also tell myself to be more independent my first year of college.  Even though I lived 4 hours away, I went home a lot, when I should have spent more time with my new friends and doing homework on campus.  I missed out on a lot of important social life on the weekends.  I would have also told myself to befriend more of the international students, as they have much more interesting lives than some other students at school!  I'm now a senior, and I wish I had more time with my friends and more time to figure out my future!  I could have started my search much earlier.",
                "Meagan ": "Being in high school again; what a rush that would be. First of all I would suggest to myself that I should enjoy it ten times more because it goes by so quickly and is way easier than what I'm about to get myself into. On a more serious note I would definitely make sure I stuck to my gut feelings. So many things can be compromised when you're placed in a new and less comfortable environment. From learning and opening your mind it is sometimes more likely to question everything you were once so sure of. After being a senior in high school you think you are big stuff and unbreakable. But its not reality! Stay level headed and not unruley; it will definitely be worth it in the long run because it will cause a lot less suffering once you finally realize you can be brought down to the ground. Hard. Keep your head up because you never know where these things will lead you. Trust me, you won't even imagine how much you will grow up and how much you will learn about your self and the rest of the world.",
                "Kathryn ": "I would tell myself to save up as much money as I could because college is far from being cheap.  Getting a part time job will help some but it still makes it difficult to scrap and claw to find enough money just to pay next semester's bill.  Aside from the difficult financial situation, college does have it's upsides.  The professors are mostly friendly and willing to help; just take the time to ask them.  The students are mostly open-minded and try for the most part to respect each other's views.  Don't be affraid to dig right in and get involved because sometimes you'll learn things about yourself and other people that you wouldn't know otherwise.

IIT is one of the most racist, classist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic schools in Chicago in my opinion and experience. IIT is a perfect example of \"diversity and inclusion\" being used as a selling point to lure in BIPOC students from underprivileged backgrounds, so they will take out an egregious amount of loans to pay for this HELLA inflated cost of schooling (50K/year JUST FOR TUITION), when behind closed doors, they promote racial divide by fearmongering out-of-state students that black and Latin neighborhoods are \"dangerous\" (yes, the whole \"don't go past 35th\" is STILL being drilled into students' heads). This issue only amplifies within the SGA leadership and administration who make light (and even DEFENDS) issues such as racism or homophobia from students (*cough *cough Dean Katherine Stetz). As a black, queer non-binary student from an underprivileged background, I have endured every bit of the evils of this \"place of learning\". To any student from poverty-stricken backgrounds wishing to get into the STEM field, don't walk away from this place; RUN. Run far away from it. UIC or UIUC has better STEM programs for hella cheaper than here."

The class sizes are typically small, but there are some that are close to 100+ students, but those are usually only in your freshman year. The professors really know how to approach teaching their subjects and are more than willing to help you out outside of office hours if need be. The school does focus mainly on academics, so classes are rigorous, but doable. It's a big campus with modern buildings and has a small enrollment size. The school is also very diverse, there are students from all around the world, religions, races, etc. and  it has a very welcoming atmosphere. There are plenty of clubs, activities, societies, sororities to join in on. If you live on campus you definitely have more time to get involved, but for commuters, depending on your commute time, that may be challenging. "

There are those who mistake IIT for a \"party school\" but it clearly isn't so those people who are trying to turn up all the time just kind of sticks out like a sore thumb all the time. As an IIT student, I can also vouch that the diversity at our school is indeed high and that's one of the best things about this school, aside from the fact that one of the world's most famous architects, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was affiliated with the program in the 1950s-60s.

Also, the school lets you get involved with various activities that prove beneficial to your career and social life. Although, there is some professor who will support you in your studies and others that won't. The reason is that the majority of the professors at IIT are funded for research studies on campus.; therefore, becoming a full-time professor or even become part of the school's faculty is a condition for the professors to agree upon if they wish to conduct their research on campus."

                "Comment": "Contrary to popular student opinion, I truly have enjoyed my time and educational experience at Illinois Tech. The people I've met, the friends I've gained, and the professors and mentors I've learned from have made my experience an extremely positive one. I've also come to appreciate the diversity on campus and love interacting with the international community whether students stay for all 4 years or are studying abroad for a semester - they've taught me so much about life beyond the classroom and I'm very grateful for those lessons. \nThere are countless ways to get involved on campus and plenty of leadership experience to go around. Personally, I was a member of the varsity volleyball team (Illinois Tech is a NCAA DIII school) and I'm a member of Greek life, honor's societies, scholarship groups, professional organizations, and philanthropy teams. The school is also small enough where, if there is not an organization or club that is right for you, students have the opportunity to establish a club from the ground up and bring a new group of students together. \nThe school's location (a 5 minute train ride to the heart of South Loop in Chicago) has been a huge perk and I love exploring the city with the school's included Ventra U-Pass. There are always concerts to attend, restaurants to try, and free events to mingle at to get off campus. Additionally, there are plenty of large conventions and conferences due to the large student populations of other big named schools like University of Chicago, Northwestern, UIC, DePaul and Loyola. \nWhat sets IIT apart from these alternative Chicagoland schools, however, is the faculty-to-student ratio and the quality of learning and resources that are available to students. The experiences that I've gained just from attending IIT (internship experience, networking opportunities, etc.) has been unreal. Additionally, IIT is one of the only schools that offers a 5-year master's in engineering track and I'm able to graduate in 5 years with both my bachelor's and master's in chemical engineering all while attending the same school. \nEvery school has their downfalls, however, and those downfalls have overshadowed the positives for some students. It can be discouraging at times to participate in student organizations because overall student engagement is rather low as students tend to possess a more introverted personality type making some school-planned functions a bust. Additionally, with the rigorous and challenging coursework, student stress and anxiety here at Illinois Tech are abnormally high and some professors and institutional members seem to brush that under the carpet. There are also a large number of students who commute to class from the surrounding Chicago suburbs and I think the school could do more to incorporate these individuals to make them feel more included and welcomed on campus. I do think that the institution is making strides to overcome their weaknesses like remodeling student housing and investing in new catering services but those changes will take years to impact the quality of life and better the student community. \nDespite the downfalls, I would not change my decision to pursue my degrees at Illinois Tech and definitely have and will continue to recommend the educational programs here.

The campus and facilities seemed boring to me at first. I have almost decided to give up on the school as one of my choices. \nHowever later that spring I got invited by the women's basketball coach to come out the the recruiting trip. Little did I know my perspective on the whole school would change and I would chose to become a Scarlet Hawk. Recruits were given a tour of the school, including academic and athletic facilities. Since IIT is a division 3 NCAA school general student population also shares the athletic facilities at certain times. The facilities feature multiple basketball courts, baseball field, turf soccer stadium, swimming pool and weight room. As far as academics go I was mind blown. Professors love to see their students succeed and are always ready to help. Not only is there help in the classroom but as well out of the class. The school offers free tutoring and the library is open for most of the day. Academic support is huge as IIT strives to produce future innovators. One of our notable alumni was inventor of the bar code. As far as student life goes there are multiple sororities and fraternities on campus. Campus is also located on the south side of Chicago which is easily accessible by  the train. One of the great features during the summer is that we are about half of a mile away from the lake beach. School is a great mixture of college experiences as well as quality education. I could not imagine that the school that was on the bottom of my list turned into a school of my dreams. "

Wiel Arets made going to Crown Hall a prestigious endeavor, and I was proud to go to all of the lectures he made possible. The curriculum in architecture changes so often that it's hard to collect any data to report on what is actually working.  The campus is seriously lacking in accessiblity to shops and retail; security is lazy and personnel are often seen just sitting in their cars; the facilities could be updated for architecture students (everything is built for engineering students!) .

Greek Life is really big for me as I am part of a sorority. Greek Life is very different than the stereotype. Greeks focus on sisterhood/ brotherhood, academics, and community service. The cafeteria is very socially oriented and often people go to a meal alone and end up sitting with someone they know. There is also a very involved student government association.

Also as each year brings in new freshman the ratio is more and more closer to even. As for seeing architecture students, we do work a lot of very different hours compared to the other majors however, it is easier because you are working side by side with other architecture students during those not so typical hours. Also, usually architecture students have less finals than other majors which is really nice. The academic work load is rather heavy but that develops really good work habits for students.",

Many of them come from different backgrounds and have many different talents.  I would say that almost everyone can find someone they can relate with whether you like sports or playing video games.  I particularly enjoy athletics and being social and not being labeled a nerd no matter how much people say that all IIT students are nerds.  I would say that being anti-social at our school is inaccurate as there are so many activities available to students, and the students are the ones who are initiating them.",

Unfortunately they have a contract that says IIT cannot get food from other vendors.  They do offer a variety of options for getting food on campus, but many students are unsatisfied.  There is also a 7-11 store on campus, and a Jimmy Johns, Starbucks, and a pizza restaurant incredibly close. "

Sometimes varsity volleyball, soccer, and baseball games are advertised on campus and students who attend can often get some free IIT swag.  Athletes at IIT blend in very well.  It's possible to join some of the sports teams without being offered a scholarship, so it doesn't really have the exclusivity factor that some other schools may experience.  In addition to varsity sports, many IIT students will participate in some club or intermural sport. Besides the official teams, other club sports such as indoor soccer, cricket, badminton, bowling, and tennis see a lot of participation. "

All of our professors are successful researchers but not all are gifted at teaching undergrads.  I have great respect for my professors and think that at the very least they are all excellent scientists.  They have provided me with opportunities I never thought I would have and without their selfless interaction I would be a much lesser student.  \r\n\r\nClasses at IIT are definitely challenging.  The workload is large and science/math/engineering classes require a lot of time and effort.  Social science classes require very little effort and students can easily earn an A. ",
                "Kris": "As I stated above, the Professors will know your name and your face. The low student to faculty ratio creates an invaluable learning environment. Plus, the professors care. When I go to visit my professors, if they are in their office they will set aside whatever they are working on to answer my questions (or just to flat say, \"You're barking up the wrong tree. Start over.\") The labs are state of the art, and I read somewhere that there's 300 of them! Undoubtedly, the most valuable part of IIT is its value of education. (And being that it's a university...that's the way it should be!)",
                "Sarah": "As I mentioned before, academic life is rather tough but I have learned a lot in my academic career so far. As an architecture student the first three years were rather difficult but very beneficial. The program is meant to weed students that aren't meant for architecture but are meant for another program. I really enjoy the classes that I've taken and the professors are very knowledgeable in what they are teaching. Also a lot of the architecture professors are in the profession and work in firms and they often like to share their current jobs with their students. Also I have a bunch of friends that have gone on to work in their professors' firms.",
                "Brett": "I love all of my classes! IIT is one of the nation's top architecture schools, and it's obvious why-- I'm receiving a great education and will be prepared to enter the architectural field when I graduate. Another thing I love is that you know everyone at school here is intelligent, and it can be much more enjoyable to have conversations with bright people.",
                "Joe": "The professors at our school get to know their students pretty well.  I stay in touch with a large number of my professors and have lasting relationships with some of them where I can go into their offices at almost anytime with any concern and talk about it.  I believe that the professors are very qualified for teaching as most have had and continue to participate in real world affairs.  One thing I would like IIT to supply are a more variety of social sciences and humanities courses.  I feel that many of them are a bit biased in one direction and not enough variety where students can comfortably pick only courses that capture their interest.  I would say that students and classes are pretty competitive as many classes are based on the performance of how you do in relation to other students.",

On campus, there is a social location called the Bog. It is open on Thursdays and Fridays. It has 8 lanes of bowling and video games for everyone to play. There is also a stage and a bar area. It's a lot of fun to go make a fool of yourself at charaoke or to watch people who can actually sing at IIT Idol. But Chicago is what makes the social life for the students. Great food, and diverse food, is all around the Chicagoland area. Plus, one student organization, Union Board, sells tickets to students for sports games, plays, and movies at incredibly cheap prices! $10 to see Mary Poppins or $5 for Star Trek IMAX tickets. It's quite a deal. Plus, last year UB invited Bill Nye to come give a demonstration. Very cool! In short, there is nothing short about all the fun things to do while studying at IIT.",
                "Brett": "IIT offers a lot of social activities for its students- they're always selling discount tickets to musicals, sporting events, and movies in the city. One of the huge deciding factors in whether I came to IIT was its location- and I couldn't have asked for a better one! It hardly takes any time at all to get into the city, so if I want to shop or look at architecture or just hang out, it's very accessible by train: we have to train stops on campus.",

I come from a background of playing a ton of sports and being outdoors as much as possible when its nice out.  What I found at first is there are many more people at our school who like just the opposite things as far as staying inside and playing video games.  I have over the past few years found a number of people who are more active and being in Triangle Fraternity I can easily find people to hang out with by just going down the hall.  I would say that in general, the Fraternities and Sororities are very popular and tend to house many of the more active students on campus (not sure if everyone would agree with that, but thats my opinion)  I helped start the student organization called Architecture That Matters and was involved with many others on campus that had their ups and downs.  I also have worked hard over the past few years with the Intramural Sports program to try and improve and expand on the sports that we offer, giving students a chance for a friendly competitive environment.  There are not all that many large parties on campus, and most are kept within a controllable group of friends (mostly because of liability issues).  Chicago is our backyard, so there are countless opportunities for both fun and education.",

I am exposed to amazing opportunities through my professors and have found great success academically.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few things I would change.  First, there is not a great sense of community within IIT.  Friendships are often fleeting and seem to be based around who is in your classes at the time, or who lives nearby.  There are not many other things at IIT to bond over.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that is less than ideal is the location.  While it is safe, it is in a fairly desolate part of town.  In a way it can be a positive in that there is no immediate temptation to leave campus to have fun, but on the other hand I am often jealous of other parts of the city and all they have to offer there.  I feel very comfortable walking around IIT at any time of night, however I would definitely not walk very far off campus at night.  ",

We all have U-passes that give us unlimited use of the CTA, Chicago's public transportation. Everyone that comes here from NY or LA leaves saying how much cleaner and more exciting Chicago is.\n-Small campus:\nThe small campus creates a place where faces become familiar. You see your friends a lot. The professors know your name. Plus, it's safe. The campus security is always patrolling and if anything should happen anywhere on campus, they will know about it in less than a minute.\n-Prestigious university:\nGround-breaking research is constantly happening at IIT. All the professor are doing their own research, which gives students golden opportunities.",

At IIT, my professors know who I am, what I'm struggling with in their class and what my strengths are. Four years later and my freshman studio professor still remembers me and says hello. Student life is also very diverse, there are so many student organizations and it is also very easy to start a new organization. Chicago offers so many opportunities as well. It is a very diverse city. Campus life is also nice because of the many student organizations and also the closeness of those living in the dorms. The communcal style living and suite style living provides a really nice floor community.",
                "Brett": "The size of IIT is perfect- it's not so small that you recognize everyone, but it's small enough that you see friends when you're walking down the street.

I would say that our school is fairly small compared to other universities, but would also say that we get a lot of respect in regards to the quality of our education.  I spend a lot of my time on campus involved with student organizations and playing pickup ball games at the gym.  We don't exactly have a great college town as of yet, but things are definitely developing around us especially in the past few years that I have attended.  I would say in general we don't have as much school pride in the sense that most universities have it where there is tons of support for sports teams and large student activities, whereas most of our student pride is in the education they receive while attending.  One experience I will always remember is helping out victims of Hurricane Katrina with a Design/ Build project performed by students and a professor at our school.",

I would want to tell him that putting effort into life is not only practical in school but just everywhere he would go. Feeling out of place and constantly discouraged by my past failures always got me down and unmotivated and nothing started going in my best interests until I started motivating myself.

The professors want the students to take intiative and ask for assistance. I have actually heard some professors say that they wish more students would come to their office hours more often.

                "SHAYNA": "First, I would have told myself to fill out scholarship applications!!! I thought that my grades were not good enough to get any. I think now I missed out on a lot of money because of my doubt and my laziness. I also would have told myslef to write my homework down. One of the main reasons I did not turn my homework in on time was because I would not write my home work down. I would turn it in a day or two and get everything right, but I would recieve half credit because it was late, which hurt my grade. At the end of my school year I started going in to ask my teachers for help with rasing my grade and completing assignments. I should have been doing that at the begining of the year so I would have told myself that too. Lastly I would have told myself that hanging out with my friends is not that important. I spent most of my time socializing when I should have been studying or doing homework.",
                "Randall": "Given the possibiility stated above, I would strive to inform myself to take the future more seriously.  At the time of high school graduation, I had no positive outlook on my future. I spent three years at a community college, where I frequently changed my mind on what career I should pursue. It wasn't until late in the fall semester of my third year that I met a few individuals who changed my outlook on life. Fellow classmates showed me the wonders and endless possibilities of engineering. I was entranced by the theory which they spoke of, as if a spell was cast on me. These conversations shaped my future and I am now entering my final year at an engineering school. Although my future has brightened considerably, there is still a presence of bleakness. I used up all available funding from the government by exceeding the amount of credits students are allowed. This poses quite a conundrum, as I am currently without means of recouping from such a loss. Therefore, if time travel was possible, I would ensure my future self knows has a clear perspective on what field to study before taking all the subsequent courses.",
                "Chima": "There are quite a lot of things I would tell my high school self. Most of all, it would be to not procrastinate! I'd tell him, \"We entered the college life as ignorant as possible, not knowing what to expect. But now, I realize that when we have questions, we need to get answers. I used to be so quiet, not asking questions even when I didn't understand something; make sure you don't do that, or you'll definitely regret it. I know college life seems like a lot to take in. It may seem scary or complicated, but running away from it isn't the answer. You just have to dive in as fast as you can, and before you know it, the worst will be over.\" Then I'd pat him on the head and say, \"Oh, and don't be afraid to talk to people. You'll make a lot of friends in college, and it's going to be a blast. Just relax, and you're going to be fine. I would know; I'm you from the future, after all.\"",
                "Cassonia": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself, I would tell myself to obtain a goal and focus. There are alot of things that may advert your focus but stay strong. Life happens and unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it. Just make the best of your situation and keep at it. Use 'that' situation as your motivator to drive you to work even harder of obtaining your goal which is to finish school. Look for the end result, it's very rewarding.",
                "Vincenzo": "If I could go back and talk to myself  when I wa a senior I would have a lot to say. First off i would tell myself that I really need to develope better studying skills so that i would not have such a difficult time with classes. I would also tell myself about the endless amount of resources that provide me with help with my classes and other things, and to really take advantage of what is being offered and put out there. One of the more important things i would tell myslelf is to spend the time to fill out a lot more scholarships. Money in my family has gotten very tight since I have been in college. Life for my whole family would be a lot easier if i had filled out and recieved more scholarships. To end though, I would tell myself to make the best of my college years and really enjoy them, and grasp the life long lessons that arise and truly utilize them.",
                "Nabil": "I would tell myself to not worry, and to not procrasninate. I worked slightly harder in my AP Physics and Literature, I would have been able to get a little bit more ahead. I was lazy as a senior, and I should have worked harder. That way, I would not worry too much about which classes I should take to graduate, and focus on learning. Other then that, I believe that I have no other regrets.",
                "Meaghan": "If I could give advice to myself, it would be that single sentence. It is a concise statement that I believe sums up much of the best advice that is available about high school and life beyond. I underestimated the value of learning about people and different cultures as a high school student. However, I learned as an engineering student and maturing adult that knowledge of people is more crucial that one may think.  High school, college and life in general can be thought of as a never ending course in sociology, and it is a course that should be pursued as arduously as any other course. Many successful and failed pursuits in international relationships, war, science and engineering, business, etc., can be attributed in part to a lack of knowledge and/or respect for people we know, serve and interact with on a daily basis. To quote a meditation from a prose by English poet John Donne, \u201cNo man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.\u201d In order to succeed in any endeavor in life, we must understand and work with everyone around us.",
                "Leslie": "As a high school student I always did well in classes without ever really being a good student.  What I really mean by that is I would not study for a test or quiz in even my hardest classes and still end up with a final grade of an A or a B.  My first semester of college proved that I did not gain the study skills needed to survive a tough college curriculum. Unfortunately, my GPA took a huge hit and made me ineligible for a scholarship.  If I could tell my high school self one thing it would be learn how to be a student and not just get good grades.  Being a student includes studying material even if you think you already understand it.  A student wants to be confident in all aspects of a subject and not just what might appear on a test.  I had to learn this the hard way but now I am really off to a great college career.",
                "Paul": "Going back in time to talk to myself senior year of high school, I would tell him to not procrastinate and manage his time well because those are the two most valuables things in college that got me through the year. During the first half of the school year, I didn't have these valuable skills and so school really hurt me during the first semester. I realized how important school was for getting my future job and so I really implemented these skills into second semester and I succeeded better than first semester.",
                "Benjamin": "If there is one thing I could tell my past senior self it would be to not worry about the small things and focus on the important things. Concentrating on schoolwork and keeping your friends close are two big goals. You\u2019re going to go through a lot of hard time with your best friend joining the Air Force but you will overcome. You will even better yourself because of it. Even if school gets tough you\u2019re going to make friends that are going to not only back you up when you\u2019re down but also help you achieve leadership spots, notably becoming Debate Club President. Throughout going to college you are going to make mistakes. This is not a burden; this is going to be the best time to learn from it and to improve yourself. Kindness is going to play a giant part of your life. Having the skills to not only receive kindness but to return it with a smile. These next few years are going to be hard but I know you can overcome any obstacle and grow up to be the man our parents want you to become.",
                "Sandra": "I learned a lot about myself, my capabilities, and my potential after completing my first year in college.  I believe one the greatest pieces of advice that I would tell myself is not to let self-criticisms or the criticisms of other people affect you in a negative way.  Rather, learn to take away select parts of their comments that are constructive and beneficial to your development here in school and block all judgments that you may think are negative because you ultimately control how you feel.  Learn to think in a positive light and have confidence in yourself because no other person will believe that you will complete school and accomplish things except for yourself.  Another piece of advice that I would tell myself is to develop a strong work ethic before you enter college.  In college, there is a lot of time given to students and a lot of work can be completed in a day if you learn how to utilize your time wisely.  Invest in a planner and calendar and develop a habit of writing in them every day.  This will allow you to accomplish many things in a more efficient manner.",
                "John": "Study hard, often and a week before a test.  Take good notes, and attend everyclass.  Establish a routine that is healthly and works for you.",
                "Donavin": "To disturb the space-time continuum is always a delicate endeavor, but a fantastic opportunity. I wouldn\u2019t offer any grandiose insights or magnificent realizations. The single indispensable parcel of knowledge I would impart unto myself is to act. Don\u2019t defeat your chance and extinguish opportunity before it can even be breathed into existence; if you\u2019re waiting for the opportune moment then you\u2019ve already missed it. So act, act boldly, act swiftly, act decisively, be defiant to the childish fears of rejection, be the wave of commotion that overtakes the stillness in the water, be dauntless in the face of perceived future failures. Don\u2019t succumb to the treachery of hesitation nor give life to the betrayal of pause. Rather than extinguishing opportunity you must stoke it by remaining eager and vigilant to act. When the flames have been stoked and the fire is ablaze remember to exercise caution and if you\u2019re insistent on keeping your eyebrows remember, no matter what anyone tells you, \u201cinflammable\u201d actually means flammable.",
                "Charles": "The transition from high school to college was a smooth voyage for me. I decided to attend a local community college that offered economical tutition and transferable college credits to a long list of accredited universities. I felt like I had my  future college trip completely  mapped out and set on cruise control. Which leads me to my crucial advice to my high school senior self.\n\nSkip community college and head straight for a four year university!  I looked at community college as a financially easy solution to get ahead of my college credits, but boy was I completely wrong. Little did I know that the four year college that I would finally attend would be more financially accomodating then the community college that held me for two years to obtain an Associate's Degree in Science, which doesn't support my architectural major at all. If I would have headed straight for a four year university, I would have been an adept college graduate out in the working field. Instead I'm over a year away from attaining my major goal,  a  Bachelor of Architecture degree.",
                "Alex": "Find a job NOW, save ALL the money you're about to make, and then take a year off and travel. Go to the places you see in National Geographic and Planet Earth. If during that time you find yourself missing school, then it is the right time to go College - because you want to! Make sure to do your research, talk to your friends who are completing their first year to see what it's been like for them. \n\nConsider financial limitations, look for Colleges with transfer programs that pay you to go to school! Do very well, take your education seriously - you wont regret putting in the extra effort to get above a 3.5 GPA -- it is only a number, but there is no denying it will open more opportunities. \n\nRegardless of whether you're in school, traveling or working, make sure to do whatever it is well because it is reflective of who you are. There will undoubtedly be tough times, but remember that the struggles make the summit that much more enjoyable. Be welcoming of friendship, introduce yourself to someone new. Stay humble and stay courageous.",

College is a very big place full of opportunities to help you be successful. Take advantage of them. There are programs like the honor roll, tutoring, academic clubs, career centers, you name it. You're going to meet people from all walks of life. Be friendly and mature but keep your focus. Now let's talk decisions. You love computers, don't you? Well don't go into that field. You love helping people more. The medical profession is for you. Do a lot of academic research to understand the degree requirement for that field and volunteer at the local hospital. Turn in all assignments promptly including homework and extra credit. Most of all enjoy the experience. One more thing, you like sleeping late on mornings, true? Well shape up. You snooze, you lose friend.  Well you're all set. Meet you on campus. Love yourself.",

                "Ramzi": "The most important thing to remember is balance. College these days is not just class and school work. College is a mixture of academics, extracurriculars, community service, internships and professional development. If I knew that when I was a senior, I would have better adjusted to all the facets of life as a college student. It is very important to be involved in college, be it Greek Life or Student Government, Internships or Sports. As a freshmen, I could have better balanced myself. Now in my third year, I have experienced the positives and negatives to being unbalanced. It may be fun to only be involved socially, but your school work suffers. On the other hand, you may succeed in school if you only focus on academics, but the professional word is looking for more than grades. Get involved right away but don't spread yourself too thin. It is important to do things that you enjoy but balance that with things that need to get done.",
                "Marvin": "Knowing what I know now about college life, I would advise myself to take advantage of every academic opportunity that was available to me in high school. I would advise myself to take as many Advanced Placement classes possible. Advanced Placement classes prepare high school students for college courses and curriculum. I would advise myself to take advantage of every community service organization within my high school in order to instill a sense of dedication that would only grow and blossom after my transition to college. I would advise myself to build a vast network of classmates, professors, faculty, staff, and friends, which will also be extremely helpful during/after my transition to college. I would advise myself to research in detail, every college I considered attending. I would most definitely advise myself to research and pursue every scholarship and financial opportunity available in order to defer as much college tuition as possible. Finally yet importantly, I would advise my younger self to relax and mentally prepare for a lifetime of memories while in pursuit of academic success.  \"Marvin, stay focused, set your goals, and achieve them, and have a enjoyable and memorable experience along the way.\"",
                "Bassil": "If I could speak with the \"high school\" Bassil, I would tell him this:\n\n\"Universal truth is scarcer than you think. Those economic models and theories look sexy, and seemingly make intuitive sense, but they discount the intensity of natural chaos and randomness that you will inevitably witness. If you wish to study economics, realize that you may never stumble upon an economic theory that works consistently. Most of your class instructors have taught 'intuitive' lessons and principles; not much of your academic career has been spent with long, disappointing, grinding, or confusing sets of empirical data. As you grow and study economics, you might be very disappointed to find out that the 'money supply model' seldomly produce reliable results. In fact, you may be disappointed to learn that accurate models rarely come by. \n\nIf 'truth' interests you, the following areas of academic focus will add valuable insight: logic, mathematics, physics (usually), or philosophy. These areas of study will help you embrace and benefit from all the chaos nature provides, rather than to study HOW to eliminate randomness from your world, a very laugable task. You will be much less disappointed in school, and much more accomplished in your field.",
                "Casey": "The most important thing to remember as a high school senior is that even if you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, it is super important to stick it through, working as hard as you can the entire year. The final leg of high school will be where you get your scholarships, colleges make the final decision on wether your accepted or not, and it gets you your final credits to make sure you graduate from high school on time. Understand that even though you still have those 4 more years of school to finish, they are much more enjoyable as the classes are focused on what YOU find fun, and you really get to enjoy them. At college you make new friends, find new things to do, join clubs that are fun, and run your life the way you want to run it. The freedom you get in college gives you enough of the taste of the real world but at the same time, still shelters you enough to learn how to deal with the freedom.",
                "Cecilia": "Past self, even though you are free and away from your parents while attending school, you must not abuse that freedom and become more responsible for your actions, because they can greatly impact you later on during your university years as well as after you graduate.",
                "Deion": "If I could go back in time, I would advise myself to take every opportunity I have regardless of how I feel about the opportunity. Try as hard as possible to finish many scholarships and make contacts with people who are doing their absolute best to help. I would continue by explaing to myself to be very proactive and to not expect things to come to me. Go after what you want to get and do not give up regarless of how impossible it may seem. You must have confidence and continue to strive to have the best success. I would advise to find what your are good at and demonstrate your prowess to many others that want to see what exactly you bring that can help improve the lives of others."

The architecture of the compass and the engineering it took to build most off the buildings is spectacular. The engineering on the tube to reduce noise levels in the bog is a good example and the architecture of the bog itself is another. Mies van der Rohe designed a lot of the buildings and boasted our campus to world recognition for being an architectural wonder. The school takes pride in how it presents itself and it's history.",

Although this is not a large university, there are always activities to engage students in the community, especially giving attention to the diversity of the population. I appreciate that students are able to create and host events that bring together different cultures, and some activities serve as an educational event to all that attend. I enjoy that culturally based organizations are willing to share their customs and views with others.",

IIT offers a lot of support for their students, making a large school seems like a huge supportive family. Going to college is a scary thing, especially when there's at least 8,000 other students going with you. Making friends  or finding help can be hard, but the atmosphere from the administration and even the other students makes new comers feel more welcome than they are in their own homes. This makes school more fun, safe, and easier.",
                "Randall": "The thing I consider best about my school is the ability to be involved in research as an undergraduate. As long as you show interest and prove to the professor that you are a diligent worker and a competent student, there is a good opportunity of landing a position as an undergraduate researcher in his or her lab.  This allows an undergraduate to gain experience in the field, as well as learning novel and innovating techniques in the professor's area of expertise.",

At IIT we have a lot of open green space which is unusual for a campus in the city.  Most of our buildings were designed by the famous architect Mies van  der Rohe.

In reality, there are a lot of opportunities to socialize and fun to be had.  There are no major barriers to creating a student organization, and chances are one already exists for any given interest.  Various groups on campus put on events both on campus and off campus that can be enjoyed by everyone.  Still, it is true that IIT students are very hard working and most people will be unwilling to blow off their commitments in favor of having a good time.

Although IIT is known very well for the amount of financial aid they offer their students, there is an approximate 4.5% tuition increase that will be applied to my tuition each year.  Not knowing this, it skewed my idea of what I thought I would be paying after four years.  I realized after completing my first year that I will be paying more money than expect, but it is a good education nonetheless.",
                "Charles": "I wish I knew all the courses that could potentially be transferred from my previous college. If I had known before hand about the type of work that the institute was looking for in transfer candidates for the architecture program, I would have been able to graduate a few years earlier.",

The area around campus does not wield much to do without going into downtown Chicago, and then everything within downtown costs money to do. The campus is very small so unless your in a fraternity there is also not much going on around campus itself. Once friends are made on your dorm floor, people hang out a lot to fill in the time.",

Currently, I am a commuting students amongst many students that live on campus because they are international students or from another state or neighboring suburb.  To get the full effect of college is hard when commuting because I don't get the chance to socialize much.  There are many fun events that gather students together and I am making the effort to go to as many events as possible so that I will be able to learn in a fun and comfortable environment.",

Since I got my bachalor's degree in China in July 2010 and decided to come to America to pursue a master's degree, students' emplyment rate and professors' reputation are both important criteria  to choose a graduate school. However, information about those is relativly difficult to get from abroad. As a result, if I had taken students' emplyment rate and professors' reputation into consideration, I could have made better choice.",

My semester in the school was a little bit tough for me due to the fact that i didnt know what loans to apply for, how to apply for them, and what that was needed to do in applying for those loans. There was a little bit confusion between the student and the parents loan. I was charged late fees because i didnt pay my tuition on time.",

The sports programs are not very good, the facilities are average considering this is a very old institution.  This campus is not very good looking, meaning you kind of feel depressed walking around, there is nothing nice to look at. I wish i had known it was going to cost as much as it does and that the education you get for the money plus facilities compared to other schools is not very good.",

If I knew about those opportunities, I probably would have chosen an other school that might have fit me better. (the other school happened to be more expensive)\n2) I wish I had a better overview and more information about other architectural programs and options within US as well as abroad.",

Upperclassmen tend to already have the friends they want, so it can be really hard to meet new people.  I also wish I were more familiar with the surrounding area.  It would have helped the transition go much more smoothly.",

First, and certainly the most important, is the fact that the entire administration at this school is a complete joke because they do not have the best interests of the students in mind when they make decisions.  The next thing I wish I would have known is how boring and dead the campus was, and along with that, how awkward everyone is.

                "Edward": "We are a pretty poor social aspect at this campus. Trying to instill a feeling of school spirit is a struggle. Much of this, I attribute to our high percentage of international students. This reason alone, however, is not a bad thing. I actually love having this much diversity, but it definitely presents a unique set of challenges that much of the student body is still trying to work out. It has been getting better, but all the pieces are not in the right places yet, but whole picture is starting to be distinguishable.",
                "Dane": "The location. While I love Chicago, there is a high crime rate, especially on the South Side reletavily close to IIT. I have heard stories from both my siblings and cousins about friends being mugged/assaulted just blocks from campus. I understand there is risk in any populated area, especially larger cities, but the pros of being in Chicago far outweigh the risks.",

                "Charles": "The overall workload of each course. The workload at my school is heavy, especially in the architecture program. Every studio/class day a set number of deliverables are due for class discussions. Most of the time assignments from other classes conflict with one another and leave students up late nights to complete all assigned work. Our final studio reviews demand so much work that many students are up 2-3 nights in a row with little to no sleep. The projects usually last a good month or so but with a design project there is always work to be done.",

                "Ramzi": "Many students prefer to isolate themselves. It is very difficult to bring people out of their shells. This fact is best obverved on weekends. Instead of a social and bustling campus, the campus is very quiet except for the greek community. Actually, without the greek community, the campus would be completely dead, always. The Greeks are very involved and are in many leadership roles in every major organization on campus.",

The school is amazing for its academics and history behind every single building but students need a place to get away and relax.  Most students go to Keating Hall which is our fitness center.  Four of the basketball hoops are broken, all equipment is damaged or in bad shape, and some windows are cracked and broken.  Its a great stress reliever to just go work out or play some sports with friends but at Keating it is very difficult to do.",

It is a small institution, so there is not an exceedingly large number of activities to do outside of school.  However, the biggest problem was that when oppurtunities to get involved and have fun were presented, most students decided to pass them by and continue complaining about their boring weekend instead.  I usually chose to do the opposite, and can say that It was worth it and I would do it all over again.",

This is changing, though; the neighborhood is developing rapidly.  Previously there were no places to eat or get groceries walking distance from campus, but now there is a jimmy johns and starbucks with more developments on their way.

Every year it's more and more and there are not enough computers in the lab, or a big enough shop. They are relocating the shop, but not for another year (supposedly). The libraries are more in use and not as quiet as they used to be.  The next thing would be the financial aid office. It is rare to find someone who can really help you. They always mess up the students accounts. You have to really pay attention.",

The academics here are pretty good and most of the professors try to make the classes as enjoyable as they can. Most professors have open office hours for you to drop by in case of any questions or issues. The food could be better, but I'm sure that's how it is at most colleges! There's a few things to do on or around campus as well as a small mall nearby. It kind of sucks but it beats WIU who doesn't have a mall at all. You don't necessarily need a car your first year because of the fact that they have a free bus system for students that basically goes all around Bloomington-Normal. There's a few parties on weekends if you're into the nightlife scene. The Bone also has parties occasionally. "

Even though the school is known for education, I am personally a criminal justice major and find that I still fit right in. Campus is diverse in terms of students, academics, activities, clubs, jobs, teachers, and more. The teachers I have come to know go above and beyond to provide the assistance that students need when they are willing  to ask for help. Outside of classes, there is always something going on and it is so easy to get involved with campus activities and meeting other people. I couldn't be more happy with my decision to attend Illinois State University."

                "Comment": "Illinois State University does have it faults, but those are either minute and/or not the fault of the university here. For instance, there are a couple of Evangelical Bible thumpers who do what one would expect them to do, but that's to be expected from every campus. Another downside is the ludicrous trash on the grounds, despite the overwhelming abundance of trash cans around campus. Although this speaks more of the average student on campus rather than the staff and university itself.\n\nOverall,  Illinois State University is a rather good college. The services they provide are fantastic and allow for freshmen to easily acclimate to university life. The many local shops are not only an opportunity for students to enjoy themselves, but are also primarily small businesses, which I find to be a positive thing. Finally, though I didn't get to mention it in the actual ratings, the cost is surprisingly minimal for a University. Sure, it's still expensive as all get out, but at least it doesn't get into the $50,000  per semester like some colleges."

ISU has made it very easy for me to transition into college life, for it is very different from what I was used to. With everything going on around the campus and all the friendly faces, it was not hard to feel welcomed to this school and environment. The teachers I have so far had were all very knowledgable and personable. The food is great and all the amenities on campus are clean and resourceful."

                "Comment": "I believe Illinois State has room for growth. Some faults that lies within the university is the meals they serve and the housing situations.  I lived in a quad and I have to say the room size is entirely too small for four people to stay. Approximately 2 to 3 people left living in a quad every semester. In addition,  the dining center has no regards for individuals who are vegan. The only comfort food to chow down on is pasta or a salad; and that's on a good day. "

The campus is so easy to get around, the teaching staff is great, the food in the dining halls is good, and housing is well managed.  I'm getting an excellent education that is not putting me or my family into tremendous debt.  I cannot say enough good things about my experience.  I am looking forward to my next three years with enthusiasm!"

                "Comment": "Overall, Illinois State is a fantastic place to further yourself socially and academically. After you get through the Group 1 general education courses, the class size dips to around 40 students per class. The professors care about you, but express the need for you to apply yourself if you wish to be successful. Extracurricular options are vast, offering  many social, academic, political, athletic, and musical groups. The housing is fine. My only regret about the dorms is that ladders are not provided if you loft. The food is good, particularly Homestyle at Watterson. I think ISU is a great fit for those seeking an affordable and quality education."

For the most part if you want to have fun you're going to have to make it yourself. It just really doesn't give off the college type of vibe I wanted to have."

The school has a castle and school for circus performers (seriously!). Normal is the trapeze capital of the world! There's always an event in uptown on weekends. Classes are good. Run of the mill state school level. "

We also get to use the public bus for free so we can get to nearby stores like Walmart or Meijer. There are also places within walking distance of campus like CVS Pharmacy or a cute little diner right across the street from my residence hall. The people I encounter here at ISU are always friendly, when I moved in the residence assistant on my floor was very nice and made sure to introduce herself. She is always there for us whenever we need it. My school provides tutoring services for those who are struggling in their classes so that no one falls behind. I have enrolled in tutoring and I have seen positive change in my grades. All in all, I think that Illinois State University is a wonderful school that provides opportunities and resources for the students."

They have so many clubs and sororities you can join to be actively involved and help make friends. The campus is easy to get around and easy to understand once you get use to it. The housing and meal plans are simple, and the campus life is a wonderful experience. "

Everything is walking distance. There are also Buses that go around campus that are free of charge for all students. The atmosphere is really nice. There is never an excuse as to not having a place to study. The library, even hallways of the dorms are quiet. There is always a place to do homework. The Professors all have office hours where you can get help on assignments. There is also a tutoring office where you can get help with any class. Illinois  State is a really good school. Go Red Birds!"

The facilities are very picturesque since some of the buildings are old architecture. Lots of trees and flowers which makes it very relaxing and enjoyable time to spend outside, especially in the fall when the colors of the leaves begin to change."

It was a pretty cool night, people didn't go inside until like 1am and it was a school night.",
                "Angela": "I will never forget the night that all of ISU celebrated the nation's victory over Bin Laden.  Students were marching in the streets and signing the National Anthem!  This celebration was huge!  I remember I looked out my window and saw Main Street FILLED with people and hearing singing!  I didn't participate because it was late at night, and I had an early class the next morning, but I heard some friends tell me that it was a pretty awesome experience.  Several thousand students joined together to express their love for their country, and to celebrate a victory of being free from our worst enemy at the time.  "
