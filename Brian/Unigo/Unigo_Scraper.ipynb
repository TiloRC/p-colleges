If you\\'re lucky, you won\\'t have any classes on Friday to worry about.\\r\\nFriday: Check out a film screening and Q&A in the early evening at the School of Cinematic Arts.

Head downtown for a concert at the Wiltern, and hopefully make it back in time for the tail end of a DJ set at a Delta Kappa Alpha party (USC\\'s coed cinema fraternity). \\r\\nSunday: Kick it into high gear and get the work you\\'ve been putting off all weekend done.

And I don't mean that in terms of appearance, because they look just the way you would expect college dorms to look - rather bland. But freshman year everyone is so excited about starting college and making ne friends that doors are always open and you can just poke your head in to chat and introduce yourself. The dorms themselves are very basic, but you have everything you need. They come with a mini fridge, a microwave, and a power strip which is really helpful. The desks are pretty manageable and while the beds most likely aren't the most comfortable ones, you can add padding! Communal showers are also a new experience that you'll have fun getting used to but before you know it you'll be rather fond of your shower shoes...!\", 'At USC, dorms are typically reserved for freshmen. Each dorm has a distinct vibe based on its set-up and the students that tend to pick it. Here\\'s the lowdown on some of USC\\'s most popular residential colleges:\\r\\nBirnkrant: With the motto, \"Eight floors of open doors,\" Birnkrant is known for its tight-knit community. As of 2011-2012, students must be on an academic scholarship or enrolled in the Thematic Option Honors Program to reside here. Rooms are \"cozy\" and predominantly doubles, with a few singles and triples thrown in. (These triples are a well-kept secret -- they have a living room of sorts, a luxury very few freshmen have.) Gender-specific bathrooms are communal and floors are coed. Located on McCarthy Quad. A 24-hour convenience store, Trojan Grounds (TroGro) is located on the first floor.\\r\\nNew-North: Widely regarded as the most social (read: party dorm) residential college at USC, New-North is a popular choice with students who are looking to go greek. It\\'s often loud, so many residents make use of Leavey library when they need to hit the books, just a couple hundred feet away. Features a cinema floor, and some rooms have sinks. Also located on McCarthy Quad.\\r\\nParkside Arts & Humanities/International Res. Colleges: These recently constructed suite-style dorms are fresh and air-conditioned. They feature the best dining hall on campus, but are isolated from any other freshman housing. There are study rooms, TV lounges, billiards, and a gym. Popular with GDIs, as anti-greeks often call themselves.\\r\\nFluor Tower: Fluor rooms are a cross between a suite and an apartment - a small kitchenette in each unit lessens the blow that dining halls are a trek away. Features many special interest floors and is quite popular with athletes because of its proximity to the Lyon Center Gym. \\r\\nPardee: Pardee is kind of like Birnkrant Light. Rooms are similar, but are located on single sex floors. Also on McCarthy Quad, Pardee is close to the beautiful Doheny Library and student-run coffeehouse Ground Zero, a great locale for studying, board games, open mic nights, and the best milkshakes in LA. ', \"I'm currently staying in the International Residential College, or IRC, and I can say that it is the best dorm you can ever have. Air-conditioning and a carpet floor are just the basics. It is new, the lift is large, the stairs are bright (they have windows that stretch from the ceiling to the floor), and the bathroom is fantastic. (it is spacious and the water is hot when it should be) You get wooden furniture, and a rocking chair! There are also a range of facilities from treadmills to piano rooms, and you will be pampered. To be honest, my room was the first thing that I missed when I went back home for the winter break.\", \"The dorms are all pretty nice and far ahead most of the other schools I considered on the East coast (George Washington University, Georgetown, Cornell).  Living with friends is very convenient through the matching system and it is easy to live with a friend, who is also attending the school even by your freshman year.  The RAs are very helpful students, who go through a very rigorous screening system.  They know how to have fun themselves and make a priority the experience of every single student for whom they're responsible.  I lived in the Radisson, as in the hotel, which has become partially a freshman dormitory with floors 3-6 housing students only.\", 'Basically only freshman live in the dorms at USC, and compared to all my friends at other schools I think they are pretty nice.

All though there are a large number of students who are from California, there are also many students from places like Texas, New York, China, and Japan. Students come from all different kinds of financial backgrounds. Some of the schools students come from very wealthy families and others come from families who could not afford to attend USC without scholarships an grants. However, I have found that at USC there is no form of judgement based on where you are from or how much money you have amongst the students. You will students with many different styles of clothing walking around campus. You may see students wearing some form of Trojan apparel (t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, etc.) or perhaps you'll see a girl in a stylish sundress or a boy in shorts and an athletic jersey. There is no such thing as the typical style of a USC student, our students each portray their sense of fashion differently. You often see students setting up booths and tables to promote different clubs, organizations and groups. These could be anything from political or religious groups to asian or black students associations or even organizations to raise awareness of world problems. \", 'Though I came from a large high school (my graduating class had over a thousand people), I was really amazed (in the good way) by the large variety of students that I met at USC. I came to the conclusion that it is almost impossible for you to feel left out in the school unless you really try very hard to.

No matter what your circumstance, you will feel welcome here.  Class attire usually consists of some sort of USC gear for the lower-division entry level courses, but do not be surprised to see the occasional business or business-casual attire as it is required for some classes for Final Presentations, Mock Interviews, and other graded assignments.  I really enjoyed this and it helped prepare me for other opportunities.  There are no predominate financial backgrounds.  Members of my fraternity have discussed their earnings in context of receiving their first post-college position after some serious probing. ', 'My classmates are all hardworking, taking 4 or more challenging courses, involving themselves with several clubs, and completing work study and internships,  and still managing to be successful in all of their endeavours.', 'The student body at USC is so diverse that no student would feel out of place here. There is truly a place for everyone at USC because there are so many different reasons why a student might possibly be drawn to this school. Students from all different backgrounds interact freely and the dining hall is a very friendly atmosphere. If I go to the dining hall by myself at any point in the day, I can almost always find someone that I know who I can sit with. Students with all different academic or extracurricular interests, as well as financial backgrounds are friends. As a whole, I think the student body is very accepting of all racial, religious, LGBT, and socio-economic groups, although there are always some exceptions.', \"This school has every single group on it one could imagine, these groups are always doing things on campus like fundraisers and raises awareness for certain causes.  I think it is fantastic to see students involved like this.  No student would ever feel out of place at this school because of its diversity, there is always a niche for everyone.  Students wear a variety of things to class ranging from sweats to cute outfits to work out clothes.  Everything is accepted!  Most students, however, seem to be from California.  Though there is diversity, there are a lot of Cali kids.  This does not mean that if you are not from California you won't fit in, it will just make you unique and will guarantee that you won't have to go home for Thanksgiving if you don't want to- someone will take you in!  \", 'They are very helpful and considerate.', 'USC is very diverse, and the presence of different racial, religious, LGBT, socio-economic groups is very prominent. Throughout the year, you\\'d see events/flyers from different groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nI honestly feel like nobody would feel out of place at this school. There is something for everyone here. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost students wear normal college clothes to class. Some would show up in sweats, and some would show up dressed up. It really depends. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t see much interaction between different types of students, just because the school is so huge, and there\\'s a good amount of students in each \"group.\" It\\'s especially hard for international students with limited English to interact with domestic students, since there is a very large international student population to begin with. They mostly stick to themselves. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would say students aren\\'t too segregated in the dining halls, especially in the beginning of the year. Freshmen love to get to know new people, and as long as you\\'re willing, just sit down at a table and introduce yourself. \\r\\n\\r\\n50% of the students are from California. 40% are out of state. 10% are international. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudents have very diverse financial backgrounds. I would say the most common is probably your average middle class families, and most are on some type of aid or scholarship. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is definitely presence of political awareness and activeness. It depends on how much you yourself are interested and want to be involved. I would say USC is predominantly left, while definitely less extreme than the other California schools. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve heard students talk about how much they\\'ll earn in the future, as conversation about future career plans sometimes veer in that direction. Again, depends on the group of people you hang around with, but in general, people at USC are pretty driven and clear about where they want to head towards.

There are hundreds of student groups that revolve around anything from ethnic and religious affiliations to hobbies, sports, and other extracurricular activities. And it's so easy to establish your own student group! Truly, the diversity of USC's student body ensures that everyone can find their niche and the familial vibe on campus prevents cliques and segregation that take away from this diversity. With the largest percentage of international students of any US university, USC is rich with culture but also draws in students from around the US. What binds everyone is the Trojan pride that we all feel. On any given day I would bet 50% of the students on campus are wearing some sort of USC paraphernalia (ie: caps, sweatshirts, tee-shirts, shorts, sandals, sweatpants, etc.) Going to USC isn't a means to an end; it's an incredible experience in and of itself that will shape the rest of your life.\", 'I have not attended class at the University of Southern California yet.

People from all kinds of backgrounds and cultures can be seen around campus. It\\'s what makes USC really great!', 'However, both stereotypes are very limiting and misleading. While USC does embrace its sports culture, the school also boasts its already strong and still growing academic strength. Music is also popular here, with weekly live music on campus, and aspiring musicians holding events throughout the year. Visions and Voices hosts a plethora of arts, music, and literary events, with world-renowned speakers, artists, musicians, and authors. USC Spectrum is another organization that hosts a number of art/music-related events. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stereotype that USC is filled with rich and spoiled kids is completely false and misleading. While the school does have a number of well-off students, there is definitely not a \"rich-society\" culture. In any class, you can find students from all walks of life. I\\'ve personally met students that were very well-off and students who were depending entirely on financial aid. With almost 3,000 students matriculating each year, it\\'s impossible to have a homogenous student population. You can find people from all walks of life here.

While obviously not everyone hails from a Fortune 500 family, there are way more rich kids, many of whom are spoiled, than I imagined.  As far as apathy, I'd say that we are actually a relatively politically active campus.  A large chunk of students get involved with groups such as CALPIRG, CCU, etc.  and do some great projects.  There are others who can't even stay awake in their Social Issues class, let alone join a grassroots movement.\", \"Spoiled:To a certain extent this is true. You can see some kids driving in daddy's brand new mercedes or bimmer with LV bags. But every school has rich spoiled people, since USC is an expensive private school there are probably more, but there are also many people here who come from well to do backgrounds who are down to earth. The school has also been trying to attract diversity from race to economic background. USC currently has the most international students out of any US university. One thing that I have noticed is that many of the undergrads who are from overseas tend to be relatively wealthier than domestic students, some are spoiled some are very hard working.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpensive: Yes it's something like 55k/yr now? but if you don't have enough money or are really smart the school will give you money to come here.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhetto: Yes, it's not as nice as westwood but it's never really been an issue (for me anyways)\", \"Mostly yes, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It always shocks me that the kids on my floor will all go out and have a good time, but Sunday afternoons and school nights (except Thursdays, when everyone goes out) are always pretty quiet in the dorms, with everyone diligently working on school. Plus, people really are beautiful! \\r\\nAlso, there are definitely some very privileged students here, but few flaunt it, and there are greater numbers of students on scholarship or from more modest households.\", \"Not at all. I`m not going to say that there is NOBODY who is rich and stuck up, but honestly on the whole I have met very few people who portray these characteristics, and because it is such a small percentage- you can just choose not to hang out with them. As for everyone being from California- not true. I think the percentage is like 51%/49% but you don't really notice it. Most of my friends are from all over the country- again, there are so many people that you can choose who you hang out with. And as for going home on weekends, campus is never really completely dead (except for the weekender!), but yeah- sometimes people go home, but they are always friendly and will welcome you into their homes, and not everyone goes home at the same time so you don't really notice it nearly as much as I thought I would.\", 'The neighborhood is, in fact, as bad as you think; in spite of the fact that the administration has been promoting the fact that the area around campus has become more gentrified in recent years, crime directly surrounding campus is still pretty high. As for the stereotype of rich, bratty kids, it varies--USC is very diverse and has students of all different backgrounds, but the \"spoiled children\" are definitely a visible part of the community, if not the majority.', 'Generally, yes.  There are a lot of spoiled kids at USC and the school is extremely expensive.  However, the USC Financial Aid department is more than generous, and USC has students from all sorts of backgrounds (some of my best friends are international) and almost anyone who gets in can get a lot of financial support from the University if they can show they need it.', \"Well, I am part of the Greek system, and I think you are more likely to find stereotypical Trojans there: rich, self-obsessed people who just want to get through college having as much fun as possible while avoiding having to work too hard. The strange part is that while you will find more stereotypes fulfilled in the sororities and fraternities, you will also find that they hold the campus' most motivated leaders, brightest students, and the most down-to-earth people. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for whether we just didn't get in to UCLA, Stanford, etc.- I think USC offers an experience that is unparalleled. There are students that got into other top-tier schools and chose USC for the breadth of experience that it offers.\", \"In some cases: we have one of the most culturally/ethnically/socio-economically diverse campuses in the world;so, it's hard to stereotype a USC student (even though many people do).\", 'Yes and no.

Most USC students are very smart, aside from the business, communications, etc majors.', \"In my experience, yes and no. The freshman dorm floor I stayed at had a lot of freshman who were wanting to pledge sororities and fraternities, since that's one of the most obvious routes to having a social life at SC. Even though this is true, you can find people who aren't like that... it just takes a little more time. There are the daddy's girls and ridiculously rich here, but mostly everyone I've met at SC deserves to be at this school. I'll admit, you do come across the random person who has no drive and very little intelligence, and you wonder how they got in when some of your diversified and genius friends got rejected, but that could be true anywhere you go and overall I'd say this stereotype is not true.\", \"Of course there are some people like that, but a lot of my friends only can afford USC because of scholarship money or grants.  Also, it's not that preppy and there's a lot of diversity at USC. It's true that everyone is pretty smart and talented.\", \"Well, USC isn't cheap, so there's truth to that part.

For those of us who don't dig the sport, it at least yields a quiet saturday afternoon every few weeks in the fall.\", 'Some of them definitely are, but you will find all of these types of students at Universities across the country; however, I think because USC is in LA, there are a lot of shallow, stuck up people at USC who think they are god or really cool and can act like their still in highschool, trying so hard to be noticed.', \"Since I don't hang out with a lot of rich, white kids, I can't agree with that stereotype. I didn't try to avoid them, but since I'm not in Annenberg or Marshall, they are easy to avoid. If you do major in one of those schools, then you will encounter a lot of spoiled children. You also see them at football games and Greek Row, but since I don't go to either of those places, I don't see them.\\r\\nThere are a lot of Asians but not as much as the UC's.\\r\\nThis school can have a conservative attitude because many students come from rich, conservative families. I agree wholeheartedly that we have an apathetic attitude. No one cares about things here. People don't vote in the elections. I could go on about this but there is no drive on this campus to change things.\\r\\nThere are a lot of intelligent people at this school, but sometimes I feel that I came to the dumbest top 30 school. \\r\\nWe are a party school, but it's definitely died down since I was a freshwoman three years ago.\", \"Connecting with people is the best way to break through stereotypes and my time year has broken a lot of those. I can't speak on behalf of Greek life or inside the athletic department but I know I have met a LOT more genuine, caring, and humble people here at SC than at my cheap public high school back home. The atmosphere might be more laid back than other top institutions but its because we have so many extracurriculars many students care about their work and keeping it at high quality.\", 'Most of the time they seem to be quite accurate', \"no, there is a large mix of all different people here and most people that i've met have been good people.  yes this school is expensive, but for the most part financial aid does a really good job of getting you whatever you need.\", \"Well it's a big school with people from every background, so it is definitely true for some.\", \"Not for the most part, there are truths to some college stereotypes just like not everyone at Berkeley smokes weed. We have one of the most racially diverse schools in the country. Most Trojans grow up long time Southern California fans. From what I've come to see is most people see us as that we think we are the best, but with perfect weather, being right next to Los Angeles and Hollywood, the beach, best sports program, amazing parties, great academics, biggest school spirit in the country, the best alumni programs, and the best looking students, its hard not to think we're the best.\", \"Pretty much, but there's a lot of international students here as well.\", 'YES!', \"Absolutely not. USC has one of the most diverse student bodies in the country, boosting representation from all 50 states and more than 30 countries.  This diversity brings the students together because we all worked hard to get here, and are working hard while we're here to continue the Trojan legacy.  USC students are very school spirtited and competitive, but that translates to all of our efforts, not just sports.\", \"These stereotypes aren't accurate at all.  Most people are here on a scholarship.\", \"Personally, I believe this stereotype for the large part is inaccurate. However, there are some students who do fit this profile. I find that most of the students described by the stereotype are part of the Greek system, and even then are far and few in between.

Take one step off campus and every thing changes.  Some times you can be on campus, too, and be hassled by bums.  There are a lot of stuck up people here who don't appreciate what they have.

But USC is a very diverse school filled with plenty of people from ALL backgrounds. I also find it irritating that people think the neighborhood surrounding USC is dangerous and ghetto. I KNOW ghetto and USC's neighborhood is very middle class, not to mention 80 percent student. I never felt in danger in the neighborhood.\", \"It's a big school, so of course there are those kids, but there is also a HUUUGE diversity of kids.  So, the stereotypes are somewhat true.\", \"I would say that fifteen years ago, these stereotypes were pretty true.  However, as the university gains rank each year, it's becoming more and more academic.  Hence, the majority of students are either on financial aid, scholarships, or both.  The big focus is football and now basketball, and the students really support both because they're good.  As for being good looking, USC students ARE really attractive!  Perhaps it's the sun?\", \"These stereotypes are both true and false. It is true that the majority of the people you meet will come from financially secure families, but that doesn't mean they are spoiled or showing off their financial status. I've never had the feeling like someone was richer than me and therefore felt more inferior from it. Also, students here do study hard and get involved in a lot of extracurricular activities/internships. PreMed and engineering students are quite often buried in their books and business students are definitely out on internships by sophomore year. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding Greek life, its presence is definitely felt on campus, but I've never felt pressured that I need to be a part of it to fit in. Also, the stereotype of the frat boy or sorority girl has been proven wrong to me time and again. Often I find the students most actively involved in frats/sororities are those who are have the most developed leadership skills and are just as equally involved in other extracurricular organizations and jobs.\", 'Perhaps, but not as much as is said because of scholarships and financial aid, which USC is decent at.', 'To the best of my knowledge, they are not. While many people go to parties, some go often, others go once in a while, and others do not at all. The student body is so large that you find such a diverse group of people with extremely varied interests. In terms of the spoiled stereotype, there are some people who take interest in showing off their wealth, but there are many more people who have other priorities. While there are some people who come from affluent families, it is not conveyed in their attitude. The people I meet are generally very down-to-earth.', \"Sometimes yes, sometimes no. There are a fair amount of students who drive swanky cars and wear designer clothes to class, so if that's your thing, you'll find something in common with some of the people here. But if it's not, you will still definitely find friends at USC who have the means of regular students. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I happen to love our football team; once you're part of the Trojan Family, it's sort of necessary to.\", 'No. As most stereotypes go, they may be true for some members of the student body (I have seen one kid with a Lotus), but not for everyone, or even the majority. There are many students on scholarships here.

My least favorite was Writing 340, which is a writing requirement at USC. Students student constantly. Because there is no set calendar for midterms, etc, each course has a different schedule. Class participation is very common. Sometimes participation is a major component of the overall class grade.

It is definitely possible to get As here, but it is certainly not easy. Many students here study much more than it may appear, although this is not the case for everyone. General education courses tend to be larger, lecture style classes that are more impersonal, but if you go to office hours and put in the extra effort, most professors are very friendly. However, many of the upper level courses within one's major are much more personal. I am a print journalism major within the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and this is a main reason I decided to come here. The classes are small, about 20 people but sometimes less, and professors definitely know their students names. Annenberg is very well-respected, as are USC's other professional schools, including Viterbi School for Engineering and Marshall School of Business. \", 'Since USC is a \"small\" school, you really have the opportunity to connect with your professors. At a big school like UCLA, you are just one of tens of thousands of undergrads, and it is much more difficult to stand out. For example, lecture sizes for general education classes at USC rarely exceed 100, while at UCLA, most have about 300 kids in them! At USC, you never have to wonder about if you are going to have a seat in class, or if your professor knows who you are. Once you get into your major classes, the average class ratio is like 15:1, student to professor, and when your professor is able to know you and your work, this has obvious advantages. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut don\\'t think that getting into USC is easy! The average GPA of high school coming into USC is about a 4.2, so you have to be the best of the best to get in here. USC does not accept mediocrity!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, USC is a private school, which has many advantages of its own. For one, classes are guaranteed; you never have to stress about not getting into a class that you need to graduate. This cannot be said of any of the UC schools, as their classes are often threatened by over-enrollment and state budget cuts. That\\'s also something that you should consider in applying to college.\\r\\n\\r\\nUSC offers a variety of unique classes, like one I am in right now called Cinema Symposium. In this class, we screen movies before they debut (this term we saw \"Drive\", \"The Descendants\", \"Tintin\", \"Hugo\", and \"Like Crazy\" before they came out), and then we have a Q&A session with an actor, or a member of the production staff. Another popular class is called the LA Experience, where the class goes on trips throughout LA to experience things that the city is iconic for. These are just two of dozens of classes that USC offers that provide unique experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as required classes go, the courses here are by no means easy! You really have to work hard for an A, as most professors feel that if you knew how to do the work already, you wouldn\\'t be in college. This is especially true in my school, the Annenberg school for Journalism. All of my professors are Emmy Award-winning reporters or producers, so I am getting a top-notch education from people who have actually worked in the field. Furthermore, USC uses technology in the classroom that each respective industry uses every day. For example, the editing software we use to make our news packages is the same software that ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN use. And, they teach us everything today that will help us get hired tomorrow. Many employers have said that this gives SC kids an advantage over others, because we already know how to use things and they don\\'t have to train us as much.

', 'Academics at my school are challenging but extremely rewarding.  Professors will know your name in the smaller classes, but if you want to be known in the larger lectures, you have to speak up.  If you are scared to talk in those huge classes though, no worries, you will always have a discussion section where you can ask questions and talk out difficult concepts with a TA, teaching assistant.  My favorite classes are those in my major, Communication.  I learn about entertainment, music, philosophy, race and class and so much more.  I feel that what I am learning in class is making me so much more aware of the world around me and I love it.  My least favorite class was again, a general elective course, and this one was about science- specifically astronomy (not my thing).  I felt that the class was not only very hard for me, but had so much information I got lost in the stars.  On the bright side, I still did well in the class. Study, study, study!  Studying is extremely important to succeed at USC, and the libraries will be packed when midterms and finals come around- so go early to make sure you get a good spot!  Students are definitely competitive here so you will need to work hard to keep up with everyone else.  The education at USC, I would say, is geared for a job.  You definitely learn just for the love of learning, but everything that you take in can be applied in real life.  At least that is how I feel about the Comm major.  You work hard both inside and outside of class.  They hope that when you get out of school, you have the experience and knowledge you need to go out and be successful.', \"Most of my professors know my name. It's harder with big lectures, but you'd have to be the one to make the effort to get to know the professors. All of the professors in my upper division classes know my name.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have many favorite classes at USC, and in one of them, I and another student choreographed a modern dance peace as a creative interpretation of a future political message. It was pretty awesome. In another class, we'd discuss the psychological and social aspects of dying, which aren't a topic much discussed. It was very educational and enlightening, and I have gained new respect for the value and integrity of human life as well as the ending of human life. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of studying depends drastically by the student and by the major. It really all depends. \\r\\n\\r\\nClass participation is very common, especially among smaller classes. One of my class was about 95% student discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents definitely have intellectual conversations outside of class. Most students you'd meet at USC are smart, driven, and thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a pre-med student, and I can say that while students here are definitely competitive, they are also very willing to work with each other. I would say that the competition here is very friendly, which is very different from some of the cutting-throat competition stories I'd hear from else where. \\r\\n\\r\\nI've taken a class on sailing at USC. It was awesome. I'd learned old navigation techniques as well as going on an overnight sailing trip, where I actually got to man the sails. Experience of a lifetime. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy major is Human Development and Aging, health science track, in the School of Gerontology. We focus on the study of aging, particularly the biological process of aging. In my major, we'd also have a breadth in discipline, crossing sociology, policy, and psychology. It's a great inter-disciplinary major with plenty of hands-on experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nI spend a lot of time with professors outside of class due to my current research. In addition, I also spend time talking with professors after class. Most of them are very friendly and love to talk to students. \\r\\n\\r\\nUSC is definitely demanding more academically from its students, and I feel it is appropriate considering the rising academic standard at the school.\\r\\n\\r\\nUSC is traditionally known for being a professional school, with many of its more well-established departments geared towards getting a job, such as cinema and engineering. However, the school has been raising efforts to establish liberal arts studies, especially with the recent endowment for the Dornsife College. The general education honors program (Thematic Options) is also a great program focused on critical thinking and liberal arts. \", 'USC is full of brilliant, caring professors. Whereas this does not describe every USC professor, most are superb. And even though many people bemoan the General Education requirements, they are flexible enough that you more often than not will be able to find a class you enjoy in a category you may not be fond of at first glance. Within the GE classes as well as all of the classes I took for my majors (Communication and French), there was a concerted effort on the part of the professors to get to know their students and offer them valuable learning experiences that both contribute to personal and professional growth. This engenders a cooperative, challenging, and stimulating in-class experience that translates to work and interactions outside of the classroom as well.', \"Accessible professors who are always willing to answer questions (even during lecture).  Fascinating classes.  Tons of work.  Students are willing to help each other, (unlike at UCLA).  However, some students don't really seem to care about learning and are more interested in greek life, partying, other inconsequential shit.\", \"Majors: There are so many majors at USC that cater to your future aspirations for instance it is probably one of the only universities in the country that have business administration,finance, accounting, entrepreneurship,  journalism, communications, engineering (any), architecture, art, public policy, computer science, film...(etc etc you get the point) available as majors in one university. One of the reasons why USC remains so popular today is because there are many majors that are tailored for careers that they want to enter once they graduate. many students participate in research, all you have to do is ask! professors love it when you help them out, it also a resume booster.\\n\\nProfessors:Many of the professors have made it a point to learn everybody's names, if you participate frequently and go to office hours they will definitely get to know you. If you sit in the back and never talk or participate they won't know you. BE AN ACTIVE LEARNER! The quality of lectures depends on the quality of a professor's teaching abilities, some are good some are bad just like any university. IMO and experience most professors enjoy teaching and want to get to know you. You don't have to go to lectures (most professors don't really care if you go at all) but it is helpful since they give you hints about midterms.\\n\\nTAs: I have to take a lot of math classes as a part of my major requirement and for that you really need to be on top of your shit. Discussions are very helpful, all of my math TAs have been wonderful and really know their stuff, if i'm ever in a jam they can help me out, same with Econ TAs. However for some other classes I feel like Discussions are a complete bore and waste of time and you're always looking at the time, the worst is when they take attendance, in that case you have to be there whehter you like it or not.\\n\\nSmart people vary from major to major, i think there are some majors that have a high percent of highly capable people who are hardworking and will likely be successful (think science,math, engineering and other specialty majors) other majors are a complete joke and honestly I don't take them seriously, sorry guys! YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN!\\n\\nGEs: While I like learning about a wide range of topics I think the lower level requirements outside of your major (such as Writing 140 & 340 and other GE requirements) are a waste of time and money. \\n\\nGrading: I hear that USC gives out relatively higher grades than other schools such as UC berkeley. This is both good and bad. Potential employers or grad school admissions might see a high GPA and are a more likely to accept/hire you, on the other hand they might know about USCs grading and thus be less likelier to hire you.\", \"Professors do know your name here! Even as a first year undergrad, you'll have small classes and get to know your professors. In larger classes, the TAs will know your name from discussion sections, and the professor will know you if you speak up in lectures.\\nStudents have intellectual conversations outside of class. People will talk about philosophy, religion, politics, social issues, etc. over dinner or in the quad between classes.\\nStudents are driven but not necessarily overtly competitive. There's a general consensus that we're all smart kids--after all, we all got in--and now we're working harder for ourselves rather than to outdo other people as we might have done in high school.\\nThe GEs are really varied and some seem kind of strange, but overall, they're good. They let you experience a lot of different topics, but don't take up too many credits; you still have plenty of time to double major and graduate in four years.\\nStudents here are definitely focused on an end goal, even as freshmen, whether that be law school or med school, grad school, or a good position in a desired career field. People here expect to be taken seriously upon graduation, and they expect to be successful.\", 'There are very few HUGE classes at USC, and the ones that are have smaller discussion sections that allow you to get to know your TA better. These larger classes will pretty much only be for your General Education requirements, or your intro classes. Once you are done with them, your classes are all pretty small. The teachers are all very dedicated and passionate about what they teach, and all more than willing to talk to you after class or in office hours. The topics of classes are interesting as well, such as The End Of The World:Armageddon Stories, or a class fully on the Beatles!', 'The education at USC defies the idea of \"learning for the sake of learning\". It is quintessentially pre-professional, and the quality of professors and classes vary from school to school within the larger university. I\\'ve had great professors and not-so-great professors, but many of my classes were very large. Discussion sections aren\\'t particularly helpful as many TAs don\\'t know how to handle their', \"The academics are wonderful.  However, academics wherever you are become what you make of them.  I have developed a personal relationship with every professor I have had.  They all know me by name, they all are willing to go grab lunch, they go the extra mile (One of my professors is a good drinking buddy of mine now).\\r\\n\\r\\nUSC has a lot of top programs.  Marshall is a top ten business school, our film school is the nation's best, we have the oldest IR department in the country (third oldest in the world), our music school is premier, and most students double major, or major and minor.  Its rare to find anyone with only one area of interest.\", \"I will speak of the business school, because that's what I know best. First of all, there used to be a strict curve to which all the business professors had to adhere. As of last year, this curve is no longer mandatory (professors are given the discretion to move the average up if they feel their group of students was particularly bright), but as far as I could tell, almost all professors are sticking to that curve. In most cases, the curve ends up helping you more than it hurts (when you get your first 60% on a midterm you will freak out, until you realize that curved it might be a B). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe students at the business school are all about getting high-paying jobs, especially those students with a finance concentration. They have their eyes set on Goldman and Citibank and will stop at nothing. I personally loved the upper-level finance classes but hated the students in them- they were fiercely competitive, not collaborative, and uninterested in putting in a lot of work. They just wanted to get a good grade and figure out what they needed to know to get an internship at an I-bank. With that said, FBE 421, a valuation class, was extremely useful- I learned so much, and from that class I feel capable of researching and evaluating stocks without having to consult Jim Cramer. Although, as I said, students are fixated on getting the perfect job, I don't think professors have this focus in mind when teaching a class. They simply care about what they do and would like to impart this knowledge to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents grumble about the GE system, and I agree that it needs a little work. It seems that professors often get disgruntled that they are teaching students who have to take the class, and otherwise have no interest in the subject. Surprisingly, and quite refreshingly, USC often has some of its best and most engaging professors teach GEs. I had Craig Stanford for an anthropology GE, and he is one of the foremost anthropology researchers in the world. I also loved one of the GE categories; it's called Arts and Letters, which doesn't explain much, but it includes the most random subjects. I took one on Modern Russian Art- I thought I would hate it, but it was perhaps the most interesting class I took at SC. The GEs here are really meant to stretch you- they want you to take things that will make you an interesting, worldly thinker.\", 'The professors in the film school are comprised of two categories: 1) They are professionals, working in the industry who use the teaching position as a means to make a steady-income. You are not their top priority and it feels as though they come to class merely to \"get the job done\". \\r\\nand 2) Professors who\\'ve committed themselves to teaching, but have no worldly experience or have never worked in the industry so their lessons are one-faceted, containing no \"street smarts\". Their lesson are in a sense valueless because the information they feed you is directly from the text book, one in which you can buy and learn independently, without paying the $1200/unit required to take the course.', 'USC has extremely stimulating classes and brilliant instructors.', \"Engineering at USC is one of the toughest things to keep up with, as the workload tends to rival a full time job. The work is interesting though, and there are many opportunities to take engineering to the next level through paid research. The engineering students are overly smart and talented, but I can't say much about the non-engineering kids as I feel they are underworked in comparison.\", \"Academically, SC was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I have loved every single one of my professors, they are understanding people who know me by name and want each of their students to succeed. \\r\\nWhen it comes to GE classes, as long as you're a diligent student, there is no reason why you should get any lower than a B. Professors like to see you show up and pay attention, and they appreciate your hard work. If you're a slacker you need to be worried, but if you're a good student then you're fine, as long as you put effort into your work.\\r\\nMy major is Screenwriting, and the classes that I've taken for my major have been amazing. The film school at SC is incredible. Your professors have worked in the entertainment industry and are legitimately there to make sure you become the best writer, producer, animator etc. that you can be. The School of Cinematic Arts is part competitive, part cooperative. There is nothing like it anywhere else, and even though it requires a lot from you, it also gives a lot back in the long run. If you're decideing between USC's film school and another, choose USC's!\", \"I'm an architecture major, so I spend the majority of my time studying and working on projects.  The architecture studios are very small (about 12 people), so you become very close with your peers and instructor.  Only a couple students are given A's each semester, so students become very competitive.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn't the case for a lot of majors, though.  I have a lot of friends who are only in lecture classes, where there can be 100-300 people.  There usually isn't much class participation and it's more difficult to get to know your teachers.  I think once you get the general classes out of the way, courses become smaller and more personal.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of what major you're in, though, USC will prepare you for a successful future.\", \"Yes, professors know my name. One can go through a class (expecially a gigantic lecture-style class like International Relations 101) without growing familiar with the professor, but for the classes in which I felt it really mattered, my professors knew each student's name, strengths, areas for improvement, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite classes have definitely been my animation classes (CTAN-101, CTAN-102 so far). They were mostly exploratory classes, probing and expanding the animation freshman class's imaginations. We did basic analog animation assignments in 102, but we have yet to really get going with it. The first two courses have been an excellent start.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hated Writing 140, but who doesn't? It's a required class, so unfortunately just about all incoming students must take  it. I had a really good professor, but the course material seemed lacking at times. The class focuses on argumentative essay writing, but some prompts were not conducive to formulating an argument.\", \"USC is a great school with stellar academics. Business and Accounting classes and students are extremely competitive.  All business and accounting classes are curved, based on the scores and average GPA of the students in each section.  This can be very good or bad.  If you receive 90% scores on tests and do well, but everyone else is receiving the same scores, a 90% will become a B+ because most classes are curved at a B+.  This methodology in the school, prevents grade inflation, and ensures that if some exams are somewhat easy, students don't all receive A's and get by with minimal work.  Usually, the exams in classes are very difficult and scores will be deviate, making it possible to receive high scores if you study really hard.  In some classes, the curve has been amazing because if the average for the class was in the 70s and I received an 85 or 90, I got an A on the exam and usually in the class if I did well on all the exams while the curve remained low.  People in business classes are generally very competitive, intelligent, and very motivated to get great jobs and go to top business schools.  Almost all of the professors I have had, have been amazing, except for professor Mendy Fygenson, worst business professor at USC, a complete nut job and incompetent.\", \"The introductory classes of any major and the general education classes have large class sizes, typically 200-250 students. In those classes, I don't talk to my professors unless it's related to my major. There are too many requirements to fufill the USC core. \\r\\nStudents tend to fill the library during midterms and finals weeks. It's hard to find a space in Leavey Library during the nighttime hours because everyone is study their asses off at that time. Students in Marshall are very competitive due to the bell curve that school has. I don't know about other schools, but my major doesn't have a bell curve which is great. \\r\\nMy problem is that students don't have intelligent conversations outside of class, but I only see that with the cinema students. They are always talking about films. \\r\\nFor the most part, the classes in my major are interesting, but I don't feel that are preparing me for a job. I don't think that all majors are like this.\", \"It's difficult to generalize all academics together so I would advise caution in reading my analysis and others. I haven't been to another college so it is not relative. \\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of people (especially those outside of the general Arts and Letters school I am in) dislike the GE requirements. I frankly love them. They are not boring general survey courses. They are    taught by some of the better professors at SC. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudents generally participate during lecture but not always in the discussion sessions. A friend told me this was because of apathy but I'm not quite sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've discovered that hot sorority girls are smarter than you think.\", \"All my professors know my name which is incredible! I don't have a favorite class but I can tell you what my least favorite class is...Love and Desire in Medieval Mysticism. It is the worst class I think any campus can offer! I enjoy class participation. I like being able to meet with my professor outside of class and ask question and get help. They are always willing. The music school at usc is fantastic. The faculty members are brilliant and enjoy teaching students about the theory of music.\", \"I participated in TO...aka Thematic Option Honors program. Best decision yet at the school. GEs are decent, my friends all had good experiences, and TO was even more interesting. Major classes are also very stimulating. Professors are fantastic and very accessible, for one of my final projects we all had dinner at the prof's house before delivering our presentations. Classes are also much smaller than at other 'big' schools. \\r\\n\\r\\nI initially was looking into the Ivy system and some smaller North East schools because I wanted small, challenging course material--and I definitely got it here despite the fact that I didnt anticipate it. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am in the accounting and business schools. Leventhal was pretty much the best decision of my life. Every semester they arrange with the Big Four a series of socials, meet and greets, case competitions, and Meet The Firms. they also send out a book of every student's resume to any company that calls asking for one. Literally, I kid you not, one week I had calls from 6 Fortune 500 companies asking me for an interview--and all I did was go to class.\", \"i'm premed so the classes are large and difficult, you have to work hard and go to office hours a lot and stuff for the profs to actually know you.  students are competitive but never mean in my experience...i'm a neuroscience major so i really liked my intro to psychology class.  overall the academics here are top notch.\", \"How well your professors know you depends on your major and if the class is a general education course or for your major. As a Science major all of my classes were 100+ and up to 300 people. The professor only knows you if you make it a point to go to his/her office hours or ask them questions after class. This means that you should get to know them if you want a letter of recommendation down the line. My favorite classes were Ballroom Dancing, Tap, Exploring Cultures Through Film, Film, Power, and American History. How much students study depends on their major. Science and Engineering kids have to study a lot to keep up, but most other majors can study right before midterms. Pre-health students can be competitive. Dance As An Art Form was the most unique class I took because I learned about dance from a world prospective instead of just a Western perspective. Neuroscience is pretty cool because there are only 5 classes that you absolutely have to take and the other 6 are up to you. 11 classes allows you a lot of room to do another major or a couple of minors. I think the education is geared towards learning for learning's sake> They try to make us well-rounded individuals, so you can't graduate without learning a little history, science, sociology, etc. I think the Social Issue requirement is good because it requires privileged people to at least learn about what life is like for the less privileged and it just might stir up some compassion in them.\", 'When meeting many USC students, outsiders presume we are just a bunch of stupid \"Laguna Beachers\", but what many don\\'t understand is our immensely large intellectual side. Students are extremely competitive to get the best grades but are eager to help each other out. The teachers do for the most part know your name, the only classes that don\\'t are the large lectures, but your TA\\'s do. USC prepares all of its students for success in the outside world and with its huge Alumni program, finding a great job will not be extremely challenging.', \"I do not like the fact that we are required to take General Education--even though I went to this school to get a broader experience. You have to take a lot of them, they're like a harder version of your least favorite high school classes. Especially Writing 140 (that's a bitch). \\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the professors I've had really love the material they teach, and the TAs are committed to their fields. Grades always depend on the TAs, who grade the work (in large classes). I've had some pretty tough graders...but with General Education, I'm willing to let a few Cs slide by. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am an animation major in the cinema school. I've taken 7 years of animation before I came to the school, so there isn't much for me to learn (I am not being arrogant). I was a little disappointed in my professor, who isnt an animator, and who really doesn't know much about animation. This is probably a singular case, because this year is the first year for animation to have a major (took them long enough!). However, I did like my class, and the friendly atmosphere it engendered.\", 'Great variety of classes to take, taught by those at the top of their professions.', 'Academics are serious here.  All of my classes have discussion sections with TA\\'s who have taken the course before and who are very skilled in the classes.  The large lectures usually have smaller lab sections, so it is normal to have TA\\'s who know your name and are interested in your work. The students at USC are vocal and well-spoken, and because we have such a variety of students here, somebody in a discussion can provide an outside point of view that exceeds the usual arguements of the class. \\r\\nBoth professors and TA\\'s are required to hold \"office hours,\" which are at least 2-4 extra hours a week where they make themselves available for the students and their questions only. Those are also good opportunities to get to know the professors. \\r\\nFor such a large university, we only have 6 categories of general education requirements that everybody has to take, and there are hundreds of options for those classes, so students generally end up in GEs that they really enjoy and were interested in.', \"Professors are great.  They are very eager to help the students succeed and love talking to you in office hours.  Engineering has a lot of hands on projects.  I have built robots and loudspeakers for class.  Students always study in groups.  There's a lot of camaraderie.  Graduates have no problem finding a job.\", 'I would say that half of my professors know my name. General Education classes are usually in large auditoriums, so gettig to know the professor on a personal level is quite difficult. In my major, however, the classes are smaller and I can get to know my professors quite well. Currently, my favorite class is Linguistics, and my least favorite was Anthropology. Students who attend USC study a lot and take school work very seriously. As a transfer student, I have experienced two different college atmospheres and their difficulty levels, and can proudly claim that fact. Class participation is good, the students are often involved in the classroom and engage in discussions and lessons. Students do have intellectual conversations outside of class on a pretty regular basis. I can recall a couple of instances when I was walking by a group of people and heard a very serious and thought provoking conversation that I found myself contemplating the subject I overheard. Students are competitive but not so much that it would be intimidating. I would say the competitiveness is on an individual level and focused on grades and not on the other students. I do not spend much time with professors out of class, only when extra help or guidance is needed, which many professors encourage. I believe that if one goes out to lunch with their professor, USC pays for the bill. However, I am not positive if that is true as I overheard someone talking about it. The education at USC is challenging and not for those who stress easily.', \"Most of my classes have been small. It's strongly encouraged to go to your professor's office hours and/or spend time with them outside of class. I feel like the education at USC is for learning for its own sake as well as towards getting a job.\", 'USC provides so many academic opportunities. The Marshall School of Business is one of the strongest business schools and provides many opportunities to network and tap into the Marshall family. Last spring break, I was able to travel to Beijing, China with 60 other business students and experience international business. This trip cost $950 and included hotel accomodations, airfare, most meals, as well as most transportation. Opportunities such as this are plentiful.', 'I am in the honors program, Thematic Option, which has smaller classes and supposedly the best teachers. This is sometimes true and sometimes not at all. \\r\\nI am in the film school also, and have truly enjoyed all of those professors. Most of the classes are very large (my smallest was 20, but my biggest was 300+) The TAs are definitely the luck of the draw.', \"professor name recognition: normally they do\\r\\nStudents study: i dont know it seems like a lot\\r\\nClass participation common the longer you take classes\\r\\nYes to many (drunken) intellectual conversations outside class\\r\\nStudents arent too cutthroat in terms of competitiveness but im not in the business school\\r\\nUnique class:  Leonard Maltin's Theatrical Film Symposium, you see movies before they come out and talk to the creators\\r\\nUSC Academic requirements: not too bad\\r\\nEducation geared toward getting a job or learning, whichever you set your priorities on.  The emphasis on occupation may be more prevalent in other majors\", \"Stay strong throughout because once you've given up, there really is nothing left anyone can do, so go to your ta, teachers, etc.  They will help you because they want you to succeed.\", \"Professors will know your name of you put the effort into your classes. Some will especially go out of their way to know your names, but if you aren't interested in the class, they will probably not know your name. Class participation is always common, with many of my classes triggered through discussions on the news, readings and other debatable topics in class. I think USC is geared to suit each person, with some classes preparing you for graduate education, some for learning, and some for getting a job. There's quite a wide range to accommodate each person.\", \"One of the reasons I came to USC was because I knew it had a great journalism program. I knew I would be getting the best education possible in this field and I love the diverse programs the Annenberg School for Communications has offered me. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other classes out of my field, however, that I have taken and I don't feel would be offered at any other university. One such class is the Theatrical Film Symposium taught by film critic Leonard Maltin. In this class, students watch films before they come out in theater and then get to here from people who made the movie. This class was very entertaining and enjoyable, but the tests weren't a cake walk; you pretty much had to remember everything the guests talked about. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother class is The Beatles: Their Music and Their Times. This is a great class all about the Beatles, what could be better? We listen to the Beatles' music watch their movies and learn about what went on behind the scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know if I ever could have experiences like these at another university.\", 'Overrated.'])\n",

There are so many programs that are available to enrich students' lives within and outside of the classroom. Visions and Voices is a great initiative that brings incredible speakers and performers to campus to host free events for students and community members. Spectrum also presents an amazing line-up of performing arts shows also free and/or discounted for members of the USC community. Students also play a huge role in this cultural component of USC whether as performers in campus theatre productions or musical/comedy performances (ie: Trojan Men A Capella, Comedus Interruptus Comedy Troupe). In addition to that, Greek life is strong but not a necessity for a thriving social life. Plenty of other groups, whether community service- or interest-based, are open to all USC students. But that isn't the only way to meet people. Some of my best friends were my classmates and neighbors in University housing. There are so many opportunities for bonding that these friends instantly become lifelong. Whether attending football games and other sporting events (a priority for the vast majority of loyal Trojans) or simply chilling at someone's apartment, there is always something to do regardless of your definition of fun. Beyond campus, LA is an incredible city with an endless list of amazing things to see, do, and experience.\", 'Football: Ever since Pete Carroll came and revitalized USC football the team has been a top 5 national contender every year, it\\'s a big deal around here.

I can\\'t hate though because I have many friends who are in fraternities and sororities and they are down to earth and kind. people join the greek system for different reasons some people look for friends for four years or for life, other want to meet potential spouses, while some want to get wasted every other night. it\\'s just about your priorities and how you handle them.\\n\\nYes, there is drinking at USC i have people get wasted every other night, others have never touched liquor.', \"If you're awake at 2am on a Tuesday, you're studying.

I am a large proponent of the Greek system because it allows you to go to amazing locations and do really cool things you might not be able to otherwise. Also, it gives you great access to another alumni network (that of your house) and leadership skills if you want to get involved. If Greek isn't your thing, however, there are many other clubs and groups on campus. I am also involved in campus Hillel which is a really good way to meet other Jewish students.\", \"If you come to USC, it's important to find your niche early, or else you'll be left out in the cold. The community is pretty segregated by different cliques that are usually rooted in one's ethnicity, major, greek affiliation. If you're not in a fraternity, you'll have a hard time finding anything to do on the weekends. It's easier for girls (who don't need to be in a sorority to attend frat parties), but social life is still dominated by the huge greek presence on campus.\", \"GREEK LIFE.  Just do the greek life.  There's always something crazy going on around campus.  People film movies at commercials here (I remember running into Carmen Elektra in the fall, I also met Tim Robbins and Adam Sandler), one day they dumped snow in the quad and had a trick snowboarding show, the things that happen here are unreal.  Ron Paul stopped by last fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing everyone is always down for though is football.  Our football team is very important to us.  Football season matters a lot, and if you aren't a USC football fan before you get here, you will be shortly after getting here.

I had to really think about my answer, because at first I wanted to answer \"of course!\" On second thought, however, I don\\'t think we are at the extreme end of the partying spectrum. Fraternities and sororities have their own social lives, and beyond that there are apartment parties and bars around campus. Overall, though, I feel like the general attitude towards partying will change drastically as USC becomes more academically-focused. It is getting extremely difficult to get in, and I have even noticed a shift in the kind of people who rush sororities. The stereotypical sorority chick is becoming more and more rare, simply because unless you are very bright and well-accomplished, you can\\'t get in. In my experience, the social scene of USC is slowly transforming. I think the attitude is moving away from \"work hard, play hard\" towards \"work hard, play a little (if any).\"', \"Parties all the time. Bars all the time. You have to watch it though because you're here to learn not to drink yourself into oblivion.\", \"Social life at SC is largely based around the greek row due to their massive partying habits, but don't think that the underground SC scene is lame. I've found that the kids disassociated with the row are the more intellectual and throw better dance parties.\", 'Greek life plays a huge role at SC. Frats and sororities are the most common way of meeting guys and girls, but you don\\'t have to rush in order to find friends. The first week of freshman year is filled with activities to meet other freshman through. And go to the football games! \\r\\nJust like anywhere else, it helps to have a good roommate at the beginning so you\\'ll have someone to go to events with. Be aggressive and put yourself out there, no one\\'s going to meet you if you\\'re sulking in your dormroom. There are ALWAYS things going on, whether at Bovard auditorium, Ground Zero cafe, or Bing/Norris theatres. \\r\\nYes, people party all the time. It doesn\\'t really matter which day of the week it is, something is going on at the Row. People also hang out in the dorms, or do any number of things really late that don\\'t involve drinking. If you have a car, be prepared to have lots of \"friends,\" because people always are itching to get off campus and go eat non-cafeteria food for a night, or go to a movie theatre/shopping center during the weekend.', 'Athletics are HUGE at USC.  Students have so much Trojan pride... football and basketball games are often packed full.  Most of the freshman dorms are great.  The building I lived in last year - Birnkrant - was so social and lively, and people always left their doors open.  Incoming students have the choice to have co-ed dorms, which are really fun.  Most of my best friends lived down the hall from me, and I actually made a lot of friends in my architecture classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing an insomniac, I was happy to find that there are people awake at all hours at USC.  If you go outside at 3am on a Thursday, I guarantee there will be people skateboarding or playing Frisbee outside. \\r\\n\\r\\nFraternities and sororities are pretty popular and \"the row\" is the most popular place to party.  However, if you don\\'t want to go out drinking, a lot of students like hanging out outside and playing games.', 'There are social activities for all at USC, to my experience. I enjoy video games a lot, so my friends and I spent much of our down-time (and perhaps some of our not-so-down time :P) playing Super Smash Bros. The USC Gamers\\' Network often holds Friday-night LAN parties for those who would rather play Starcraft, Smash Bros, Rock Band, or a number of other excellent titles than engage in \"normal\" social activities... Heheheh....\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, there\\'s plenty to do for everyone. I\\'m not a big fan of the whole Greek scene, but it\\'s there for those who are into it.', 'My biggest criticism of USC, is the surrounding area and campus life.  There is really no place to go to hang out around USC and enjoy yourself.  We have the row, and if you\\'re in a fraternity it is fun to party at your house and with friends, but it definitely gets old being in the same place everyday or every weekend.  There is one bar that everyone goes to: the \"9-0.\" It is fun but a really small bar and you just get super drunk everytime you go there, and see the same people every night, that are mostly all in fraternities and sororities.  I\\'d say greek life dominates USC, most people that have a lot of friends and an active social life are greek.  There\\'s other stuff to do outside of USC, but it is sort of a bubble around campus and greeks have the social lives that others don\\'t. This is pretty much USC social life in a nutshell, besides football games and other sports events that are awesome and provides for a great experience.  There are parties but they can be limited and pretty small.  I wouldn\\'t call USC a party school, it has definitely toned down very quick since 4 years ago, and it really seems pretty quiet now.  There aren\\'t many places to go out to eat or just hang out - USC really isn\\'t a college town, it is in a ghetto area of downtown LA which can get annoying to live in.  Downtown LA and hollywood are close and the beach is not far either, however.  I\\'d say USC\\'s student life can get lame after awhile and other schools in college towns definitely have more fun and more to offer as a place to live.', \"There are over 600 organizations on this campus. There is so much to do if you're willing to get yourself in it. The easiest way to know about the orgs on campus is to attend the student involvement fair. There are many Greek organizations---USC has the largest Greek life on the West Coast, but if you don't wan to become Greek, there is no pressure to do it. If you want to party, you can also find one or you could start your own. If you don't want to stay on campus, you can always explore LA, but it's best if you have a car because LA public trans is not the best.\\r\\nFootball games are a big deal, but that's not your thing, you can join me because I won't be going to the games. We also have a thing called Visions and Voices which is a great program. Guest speakers and performances have come through this new arts & humanities initiative. Take advantage of Visions & Voices. I saw Color Purple (the play) for free because of this program.\", 'There is a LOT of philanthropy and social issue causes for the surrounding community.

Big people come to speak. Not like the President of Iran at Columbia but big enough to make you want to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo many traditions to mentioned. Most notable is the senior fountain run which is a much better idea than UCLA\\'s undie run. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople go to the row a lot but sometimes that can have a stigma of being a \"row-hoe\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMost parties don\\'t have alcohol but people are very accepting if you choose not to drink.', 'Again...school spirit is incredible! Also, there are soooo many clubs and groups students can join. There is literally somthing for everyone.', \"most of my dorm is pretty social, but there are a few people that i don't even know their names...but that's their choice i guess.  all of my close friends live on my floor, because i live with them and i met them first i guess...then i have some friends from classes and parties but not very many. football is intense here! i love it.  if i'm awake at 2am during the week then i'm studying or watching tv, if it's the weekend i'm out at a party or hanging out with friends or something.  there's a traditional senior fountain run which sounds pretty awesome, kinda a rite of passage thing i guess. the greek scene is pretty fun ;)  but if you choose not to drink there are plenty of other fun things you can do.\", \"There are a lot of open dorm rooms at the beginning of school years. Football games are huge! Make sure you get a student activities card as soon as they go on sale! You will feel left out if you don't get one. Basketball games are popular when we are winning. Celebrities come to our football games all the time (Snoop, Will Ferrell (alumni), Denzel Washington, past players, etc.) Some guest speakers are more popular than others (Spike Lee, Ice Cube, etc.) but they are all free to students which is awesome. Conquest and Save Tommy Night take place the week of the UCLA football game (usually there is a band (last year it was The Fray). SpringFest takes place in April every year. We usually get a pretty cool band (The Roots, Lupe Fiasco, etc.) USC is in L.A. Enough said. You can do ANYTHING You want to do off campus. Thursday nights are the big party night because most partyers don't have class on Friday and go home. The 9OI Club, The Row, any off campus student Housing, and Leonardo's (for athletes and black people are big party spots around campus.)\", \"Obviously the best thing about USC is football season. Game day is the best day of the year... wake up, party with thousands of people all around and off campus, go win another game, go celebrate. Greek life is pretty important here, but there are enough fraternities and sororities for everyone. Life not going greek is not the end of the world though, many people do not end up going greek. You can determine on your own how much you want to party. If your not on a sports team or in a sorority, its pretty easy for girls to get into any party, for guys, not so much. Your right next to Los Angeles so if you don't feel like partying on campus, or don't want to party at all, there is so much to do.\", 'Great Greek life (stay away from the \"party\" frats, trust me - go with the high GPA Greeks), great evenst with lots of free food (though lots of creepy freeloaders who wander into campus from holes nearby) and screenings of new releases.', \"There are probably too many groups on campus to know which ones are the most popular, but definately one of the most recognizable is the Spirit of Troy Marching Band, a three hundred member strong group of young musicians who are responsible for intimidating the other team and pepping up the 92,000 specatators at each home football game. \\r\\nDorm life is totally relaxed and easy to get to know everyone on your floor and even in your building because everyone is looking for people to hang out with all the time, and it's really fun to just hang in someone's room for a night. Most of my best friends are the ones I've met in my dorm, and I'll be living with them again next year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are always things to do on campus. We have guest speakers and bands and comedians and dancers and all sorts of performers come to campus and do free shows for students.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA few weekends ago, the University sponsored a school-wide event called Springfest where bands peformed in the quad from noon to midnight on a Saturday, with some bands including Saosin, Young Love, the Aquabats, and with Lupe Fiasco headlining it. IT WAS AMAZING.\\r\\n\\r\\nFraternity and sororities are popular, but definately not a necessary part of the college experience. They are a great way to meet new people and keep busy though.  My friends who are in sororities love them, but my friends who are not in them do not want to join, and are fine not being in one.\", \"There's a club for absolutely everything you'd want to get involved with.  I had never fenced before I came to college and randomly showed up to a practice because I had seen them at the activity fair and now I'm on the team.  Students in the dorms leave their dorms open and everyone will just come in to your room and talk.  Football is the most important part of the Fall semester for all students.  Everyone goes to the games.  There is a lot to do on and off of campus.  Los Angeles is amazing.\", 'I would say that the Greek System at USC is large and very popular. The Row, which is the street with all of the sorority and fraternity houses, is a popular place for parties and social exchanges. I did not attend USC my first two years of college, so I do not know the dorm experience at this particular school. There are many USC traditions that a very long standing. Football season is a very exciting and important time of year for the student body and alumnae. Before every football game, home and away, one can see thousands of die hard USC fans decked out in the signature maroon and yellow. Tail-gating is very popular and provides a great bonding experience for the students. Another tradition would the rivalry between USC and UCLA. During the annual USC/UCLA football game the campus is transformed into a carnvial. I find that in most cases, similar with my own, that upper classmen tend to move farther away from campus. The first two years students tend to live in dorms or in apartments in the campus area. However, I find that juniors and seniors move to farther away places such as Pasadena and Santa Monica.', 'Greek life is a big deal on campus, but you can still have a social life without being a part of it. In the dorms, people usually leave their doors open; I\\'m pretty close with everyone on my floor in the dorm. Instead of going to \"the row\", a lot of people hang out on campus or go explore L.A.', 'The Greek life at USC is one of the best. Students at USC are unique because they are able to work hard but also balance a great social life. Football season is one of the greatest experiences, walking on campus and tailgating with students, alumni, and fans. USC is also located close to Hollywood and that type of scene. There are so many options, from going to the row, to going to the Grove to see a movie, to going clubbing in Hollywood. Everyone can find something that they enjoy doing.', \"The most popular groups to join are the sororities and fraternities, but I am not in one and do not feel excluded at all. I go to the frat parties sometimes, and even though I don't drink, I don't feel uncomfortable.\\r\\nThe guest speakers we get are incredible. In my two years here, I have seen Steven Spielberg, Jane Goodall, Spike Lee, Quincy Jones, Josh Schwartz, Rufus Wainwright...\", \"Frats are most popular\\r\\nIm involved in the history group, and I never go.  \\r\\nYes they leave dorm doors open\\r\\nAthletic events - football very popular.  Guest speakers - yeah sure.  Theater - never been\\r\\nDating scene - Same as everywhere else\\r\\nClosest friends - meet with cell phone\\r\\nawake at 2am on a Tuesday, I'm probably at a party somewhere or maybe coming back from a bar\\r\\nPeople party a lot\\r\\nFraternities/sororities are very important to certain people, other people don't care.  Depends on what you want in college, the party scene is similar either way\\r\\nLast weekend - went to a party on Friday, a huge party with a band on Saturday, and completely and totally relaxed on Sunday April 20th\\r\\nSaturday w/o drinking - you dont have to drink at parties and theres plenty of non-drinking activities on campus and around.  I mean you're in Los Angeles\\r\\nOff campus - go to beaches or explore LA\", \"The most popular groups on campus would have to be the Football team and Greeks. I am personally involved in VSA, a small group of, naturally, Vietnamese people who get together, mostly socially to engage in different activities. Students in dorms most definitely leave their doors open. Athletic events, guest speakers and pretty much everything are VERY popular. I met my closest friends firstly through classes and secondly, my largest circle of friends came from VSA. There are SOO many traditions at USC you cannot begin to list them all. Last weekend I attended USC's annual Springfest with Lupe Fiasco and I also attended UVSA's annual Friendship Games! UVSA is the umbrella of 13 different Southern California VSAs to network and make friends.\", \"A tradition that happens every year is the Senior Fountain Run. This is where all the seniors run from fountain to fountain and play in them. Every year, though, the administration tries to shut down some of the fountains so that the seniors can't play in them, but they always find a way around it.\", \"If you play football or basketball you're a god.  Everyone wants to suck your dick, guys and girls both.  It's no wonder Matt Leinart stuck around another year.   Nobody realizes it's the nerdy engineering kid who'll own the team those guys end up getting their paychecks from.  I feel fraternities and sororities are overly emphasized.  Everyone forgets they were all accepted to USC before anyone ever went Greek.\", 'Choosing your dorm can make all of the difference freshman year. Apartments are a bad choice for freshmen, it\\'s harder to find friends. New-North is perfect for those looking to join the Greek system/party. Marks Hall/Trojan Hall change slightly every year but are consistently more academic/quieter. Parkside is quiet/antisocial. Everything else is somewhere in between, but I think being on campus is important freshmen year.\\r\\nFootball gamedays are an incredible experience. Even if you don\\'t think you\\'re into football, buy tickets and go anyway. No student should miss this experience, and no event will fill you with more Trojan Pride. Sadly, every other sport suffers from nearly zero student support.\\r\\nGuest speakers/events are interesting. I\\'ve seen Spike Lee, Barack Obama, Ron Paul, Quincy Jones, and Tom Brokaw all speak for free. Spike TV hosted the Video Game Awards from the Galen Center, College Jeopardy filmed from the Galen Center as well, the Emmy\\'s were right across the street (until this year), and free concerts are common. The school also pays for students to see musicals like Avenue Q and Wicked.\\r\\nThe Greek System is prevalent and vocal, but not totally necessary depending on your gender. For girls, the Greek System is pretty much completely unnecessary and for rich spoiled girls. Any girl can get into any party. For guys, the Greek System is vital if you want to go to parties on the Row (the best place to go to parties generally). The standing rule Row-wide is \"Know a bro... or be a ho\" for getting into parties.\\r\\nI love my fraternity, Theta Chi, because it offers the partying/brotherhood/leadership outlet of a fraternity, without the bullshit hazing/humiliation/stupidity that comes with most of them. Brothers are expected to put school first and treat all brothers equally regardless of seniority. It\\'s small enough so that I know every guy very well, and every guy in the fraternity is a quality guy.', \"USC has a very strong social life. I enjoy how USC can be a respected university but still knows how to have fun. However, there is too much emphasis on white greek life on USC. They are only 25% of the population, yet they are representative of the whole university in most media. Minority greeks are not as supported by the university, as well as other organizations that are non-greek. Although a strong social life, I head an organization on campus and in recent years, student involvement has fell off EVERYWHERE. When I came here, most student orgs were very strong. Nowadays, the same orgs have dwindled in numbers. Some have even disappeared. I think today's student keeps to himself more, that is, until the weekends.\", 'Greek life applies to about 1/4 to 1/3 of the student body... but it never feels like you\\'re left out if you\\'re not involved. Just about everyone is involved in some other organization on campus, and these vary from dance groups to community service to cooking together. \\r\\n\\r\\nAthletic events are huge at USC. Football is part of the school life in fall. Just about everybody goes to the football games. The other sports don\\'t receive quite as much attention, but the school definitely puts a lot of money into athletics.\\r\\n\\r\\nUSC gets a lot of guest speakers through the School of Cinematic Arts, Annenberg Communications school and also Marshall Business School. We have a lot of free movie screenings on campus as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I am up at 2 am on a Tuesday morning, which is quite often, I am studying or doing homework. Sunday through Thursday are work days. Thursday through Saturday tends to be more for relaxing. I feel like the best motto to fit USC is \"work hard, play hard\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not to involved in the party scene, so in turn I actually end up going out a lot to various places around LA on weekends and as relaxing activities. The LA metro system is not the fastest, but it can let you go anywhere you want to with a bit of planning and patience. Last weekend, I went to Santa Monica by bus to enjoy a movie, the beach, and shopping all together. My friends and I take advantage of the Visions and Voices arts events that take us off campus. USC\\'s Visions and Voices initiative pays for all the tickets and expenses and offers us a great opportunities to see plays, musicals, ballets, and various other performances. \\r\\n\\r\\nTraditions: Conquest carnival before the big game against UCLA. Welcome Week -- lots of fun activities including fairly well known musicians and other performers. Home football game tailgates all around campus -- a sea of cardinal and gold.', \"One group I am involved with at USC is called A Community Place. It is a community service organization that gives out food to the poor and homeless in the community three days a week. It is nondenominational although it gets a lot of support from the University Religious Center. On Thursdays we pack sack lunches and on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday we pass them out from 11-1. This organization has given me a chance to learn about the surrounding community, which is not particularly affluent, but is culturally rich and historically important. The three-seven hours I spend working with ACP are some of the best of my week. \\r\\nWhether or not students in dorms leave their doors open largely depends on the dorm. Certain dorms are known for always having their doors open and with other dorms it depends on the year. In my dorm, I have my door open the majority of the time and as do the majority of the people. I walk in and out of my neighbors room and they do the same. It is very friendly without being too loud. \\r\\nFraternities and Sororities at USC make up about 25% of the social life. It is definitely not necessary to be in one in order to have a social life. People not in the frats or sororities can go to the parties or they can go to parties that are not put on by Greek life at all. Or they can not go to parties at all. I personally don't drink and I find plenty to do without drinking. I know people and am friends with people who go out and drink, but I also have many friends who do not. We usually will see a movie, go out to dinner, go to a sporting event, explore Los Angeles, or hang out in our hallway instead of going out and drinking. As I have said before, there are so many people at USC that you will be able to find people who have the same penchant for partying or for not partying that you do. \\r\\nOff campus there are so many restaurants, shops, and concerts around in the wonderful and expansive city of Los Angeles.\", \"USC Helenes is the best group on campus! We're the official hostesses of USC, and we have a very strong presence on campus-- involved in community service and pretty much everything else USC has to offer. If you're bright, friendly, into serving others, and want to make a difference- this is the place for you. I have made my best friends in Helenes, and if you ask any of us what our favorite organization is, we will tell you it's Helenes! \\r\\n\\r\\nAthletic events are by far the most popular events.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people party 7 days a week and twice on Thursdays. I had one semester where I went out more than I usually do, but I still could never keep up with some of these kids. They work hard and play hard. I can only handle both in moderation, so if you found me up at 2 am on a Tuesday, I would probably be working on a movie or watching one.\", 'Greek life is very visible on campus, but by no means the only way to participate in campus life. I think one reason they\\'re so visible is purely because they all wear their sorority\\'s/fraternity\\'s T-shirts. Other students may be equally involved, but you just don\\'t know until you talk to them. But when you do, you find out they\\'re a tour guide who works in the Student Body Government and volunteers with Troy Camp, too. Or, they do JEP and dance in the Repertory Dance Company. There are so many ways to be involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimal Scream is one of my favorite things each year. It\\'s during exam week each semester, and it\\'s just a way to let-loose. Things done in the past have included free chair massages, a ferris-wheel on campus, and free Subway. The band also plays every night from 10-10:15pm, and the campus housing sponsors some kind of cookie/ice cream/candy/soda thing each night. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also love Save Tommy Night. Each year before the UCLA game Tommy Trojan is wrapped in foam and duct tape for protection. Bounce houses and other huge toys are set up, and people play while \"keeping guard.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nFootball games are a big deal. I love walking to the games in the sea of cardinal shirts and people tailgating. Even alumni come back to join in the fun!\\r\\n\\r\\nI always left my door open in my dorm, but the apartments are more closed. But then, in an apartment, you have more roommates... so it balances. And all campus housing has activities for the dorm/ apartment as a whole, so it\\'s easy to get involved and meet people.'])\n",
      "What are your classes like? \n",
      "(['Kendall', 'Trenise', 'Anna-Catherine'], [\"My classes from my major have been very interesting.  I think of Comm as a degree that covers entertainment, the economy, news, public speaking and writing skills and much more.  Most of the classes ask you to critically think and want you to look at the way the media shapes the world that we live in and how it has affected the ways in which we perceive things around us.  Everything is encoded with meaning.  Some teachers despise mass media, others love it.  Pop culture or past culture, Comm classes have always kept me interested.  My classes for my GEs have been less interesting to me because they don't necessarily apply to my major (umm, Buddhism?)  but I think they are helping me become a more well rounded person and are certainly increasing my curiosity in other subjects, such as Anthropology, which I hasn't even begun to consider.   \", \"Classes at USC are very intellectually stimulating regardless of what one's area of study is. Not only that, but there are also an array of really fun classes at USC that can only take place at a school like this one. Where else would you be able to take a class where you screen new movies before they come out, and have Q and A sessions with the members of the production staff? What other school can bring you classes with Hugh Hefner, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorcese? \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the major classes go, USC is staffed by a variety of experts and professionals, from theatre to engineering. In the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, all of the journalism professors have worked in the field, many of them have even won Emmy's and Pulitzer's for their work! Being able to learn from people like this gives us an extra edge over other journalism students.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regards to class size, since USC is a private school, all major classes have very small, intimate numbers. The average class size is 15:1 student to professor, which means you really have the opportunity to get to know your instructors since you aren't competing with so many thousands of other students. At a school like UCLA, a public school, you are just one undergrad in a sea of thousands. Even the general education lecture halls rarely have more than 150 students, compared to 300, which is the standard size for the UC schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other good thing about USC is that all of the classes are guaranteed. You never have to worry about not being able to get into a major class because of availability, something that is ALWAYS an issue with the UC schools. Sure, you may not getting to that crazy popular GE class, but you will always be able to get into the classes you need to graduate. \", 'I am a freshman, so my first semester classes have been mostly General Education courses and other requirements. My two general education courses are large lecture halls that break up into smaller discussions. However, not all classes at USC are this large even though it is such a large university. My Spanish 3 class only has 19 students, which is smaller than the class size at my high school where some classes had up to 32 students. This makes a huge difference in a language class because there is the availability for the professor to give individual attention to students and all students can participate so that they can improve their speaking skills. I was intimidated by taking a college language course originally because I was always self-conscious about speaking in front of my classmates, but my professor was very encouraging which made it an enjoyable experience. Now, I am even thinking of minoring in Spanish and I am continuing with it even though I finished my requirement. My fourth class, Writing 140, was also small with only about 17 students. This class is known to be very challenging, but the professor is able to give individual attention and was very accessible to help outside of class. Overall, my classes were challenging, but enjoyable this semester. '])\n",

USC has a large emphasis on becoming a member of the Trojan family.

At about seventeen thousand undergraduate students, I believe that USC is the perfect size. There are always new people to meet who have interesting and diverse backgrounds and interests. When I tell someone that I attend USC they normally react with statements that I am very smart. I believe that this is a good thing because this means that my school is recognized as a respectable academic establishment and that is something that I am proud of. Located in the heart of Los Angeles we are definitely not a \"college town.\" However, USC\\'s location is special because students are able to have the college campus experience within a big city. It is as if they are getting the best of both worlds. USC students are proud to be Trojans, therefore almost anywhere you look on campus you will see different forms of school spirit.

Great academics, a wealth of extra-curricular organizations, community service, the benefits of living in Los Angeles (including BEAUTIFUL weather), and wonderful people abound on this gorgeous and vibrant campus. One of the best things about this school, for me, is the flexibility and encouragement they offer students who want to try many different things. Especially if you are getting a B.A., it is easy to add a minor or a second major (or both). One of the things that appealed to me most when I was applying here and considering whether or not to attend, I was drawn to the encouragement they offer students who want to explore many different interests. As someone who came into college completely unsure of where I wanted to go, the prospect of being able to be exposed to so many different things was fantastic. This doesn\\'t only apply to academics, either. There are so many different clubs and organizations at USC that are full of motivated and creative individuals. They can help you learn so much about leadership and about the organization they are a part of. It is wonderful! Another thing to love about USC is its size! It\\'s just right, in my opinion! It\\'s big enough that you feel like you always have the opportunity to meet new people and there are lots of different kinds of people, but it\\'s small enough that I inevitably see at least 3 people I know when I\\'m walking around campus between classes. USC is also right in the heart of Los Angeles. We\\'re 10 minutes away from down town and as soon as you step off campus, you feel like you\\'re a part of the living, breathing creature that is the city. This is one thing that some people on campus complain about, being right in the middle of Los Angeles (and not necessarily the best part, either), but I love it! For one thing, it exposes people who have never lived in cities (like myself) to city life and what it\\'s like to live in an urban environment. But also, being surrounded by the busy city makes campus a kind of beautiful oasis in the middle of it all. It\\'s so beautiful and peaceful compared to the city of Los Angeles that you can\\'t help but love it and feel like it\\'s home. One final thing (amongst the many amazing things) about USC is the school spirit. It\\'s crazy, it\\'s contagious, and it\\'s impossible to escape! There is nothing quite like going to a USC home football game and being a part of the student section, your face painted cardinal and gold, your arm aching from holding up your \"fight on\" V for victory, your voice hoarse from cheering on Matt Barkley and your eyes shining from the lit Olympic Torch in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum! You feel like you\\'re a part of this huge collective, that mythic thing called the \"Trojan Family\" and you just love it! ', \"Overall, coming to USC as an international student who has grown up in the US, UK, and in Southeast Asia was a truly life-changing decision and I would not be the same person if I had chosen otherwise. USC has allowed me to grow not just academically in allowing me to complete a dual degree in completely different majors, but it has also trained me to be a leader. The faculty actually care about their students' well-being and classes are small enough for professors to actually know your name. The campus is not in the best area of LA, however the area is being gentrified and it developing at an incredible place. \", \"The amount of school pride in USC is amazing, and students really love their school. (that includes me!) And it's really great to see such enthusiasm about the school, since you will feel that you came to the right school, even if you had reservations when you first came. It can be attributed to our strong performance both in the academic scene and the sports scene. For academics, we constantly receive large amounts of donations, which is extremely important for engineering majors where research will definitely help in the resume. For sports, our football team was ranked in the top 5 nationally last season, our women's volleyball team went to the Final 4, and our men's waterpolo team won its fourth consecutive national champion!\", '', \"The best thing about our school is spirit. Cardinal and gold can be seen everywhere, everyday, at anytime. You won't go through a day without seeing USC gear. Even though there are students from everywhere around the world with different backgrounds, USC really ties everyone together. I know it's cliche but the Trojan Family definitely exists. \", \"The best thing about our school is spirit. Cardinal and gold can be seen everywhere, everyday, at anytime. You won't go through a day without seeing USC gear. Even though there are students from everywhere around the world with different backgrounds, USC really ties everyone together. I know it's cliche but the Trojan Family definitely exists. \", \"I think USC is the perfect size. It is a private institution so the student population is much smaller than that of a public school. A lot of my friends who go to UC's complain about lectures that are extremely overcrowded, but I've never felt that any of the classes I've been in enrolled in (even the larger GE classes) have been too crowded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people find out that I go to USC, they are really impressed. They know that it is a renowned institution that is impressive both academically and socially. (They don't hide the fact that they're jealous of our Trojan Network, either!)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe school pride here is like nothing I've ever seen. It's almost contagious. In high school, I didn't really have much pride for our mascot and sports teams. But becoming a student at USC means so much more. You become a Trojan, and it's not a feeling you can describe...it's a connection you feel once you're here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most frequent student complaints probably come from DPS, the campus police/security. It's true that the bike impounding and traffic citations are annoying, but their presence is something we need, so just be cautious and follow the rules.\", 'I love USC and I can say that I could not have made a better \"total\" decision for school.  USC was a complete longshot for me as a student and I could not be happier with the friends I\\'ve made, the classes I\\'ve taken, the experiences I\\'ve had, shared with those friends, and those that still remain as I approach graduation.  As a first semester freshman, I pledged a fraternity, Sigma Nu--it was the first and one of the most influential decisions of my college career.  As a engineering student and a member of an IFC fraternity, keeping a balance of academics and social life has been difficult, but it has been one of the most positive life-defining experiences of my life.  People are mostly impressed by attendance of USC and also  anticipate a party animal lifestyle, which I must confess is available for those who will seek it.  School pride is at its highest, as we continue to receive large donations from families towards improving the scholarship opportunities afforded to students from alumni families.  It is even higher in light of, our beloved 3 year starting quarterback, Matt Barkley\\'s decision to return to school and forego an early departure for the NFL draft.  One experience I will always remember, as well as the internet, will always be the opportunity I received to be featured in an ESPN article comparing he and I in the midst of our freshman year.  Link: http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=reilly_rick&id=4602982&sportCat=ncf  I will say that USC is not the environment of the Spoiled Children that we stereotyped to be.  The campus is located extremely close to the storied \"South Central\" area of Los Angeles and thus is the setting for several instances of petty crime.  We do, however, boast one of the largest, most professional Public Safety forces, who vigilantly maintain our neighborhood, protecting not only USC students, but the surrounding magnate middle and high schools.  Attending USC is the most definitive experience of my life.  I have made friendships, I will cherish and maintain the rest of my life, professional aspirations, unrealizable anywhere else, and had unique experiences, I could never imagine.', 'My decision to attend USC was arguably one of the best decisions I have ever made.  I absolutely love SC and would recommend it to anyone.  I think the best part of USC is the sense of spirited community.  I think part of this comes with the nature of the athletic department and the pride USC takes in their sports, but the overall spirit is unlike that of any other school.  In regards to size, USC is just large enough to be diverse in its student body, while not being overwhelmingly large.  I spend most of my time on campus at the new and may I say gorgeous Ronald Tutor Campus Center.  You are bound to run into friends there and I found that it was a great place for lunch dates with my friends.  If I am not at the Campus Center, the gym is also a great place to meet people while being productive.  Located in the heart of Los Angeles, you can be at the beach in no more than twenty minutes or in Hollywood in nearly the same amount of time.  There is no shortage of activities to participate in both on campus and off campus.  I am proud to say that I attend USC and I cannot rave enough about it.', \"Since I started attending USC last fall, I have had a plethora of exceptional experiences that have assured me that my decision to attend USC was the right one to make. The best thing about USC is the student environment and atmosphere. While our undergraduate programs are highly competitive and large, the student organizations that are part of USC ensure that all students interact with one another and enjoy the time they are at USC. When I tell people I go to USC, the first thing they ask me is how fun it is. USC has a reputation of having a great student atmosphere while offering rigorous and challenging academics. When I go to campus, I love spending time at the Tutor Campus Center. Opened only 2 years ago, the Tutor Campus Center boasts a brand new food court, with Panda Express, Carl's Junior, Wahoo's, CPK, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf as well as Lemonade. This new campus center is the hotspot for students and is a great place to meet your friends for lunch and enjoy the surroundings. USC's administration truly hope to help students as much as they can. Each day, I receive emails from my school discussing internships and job offerings. The administration is truly involved with students and wish to help them as much as they can. The most recent controversy on campus was when a fraternity member was photographed having sexual contact with woman from another school on top of one of the buildings on campus. The story headlined on many local news stations around southern California. USC is known for it's school pride, mostly towards our athletics. Recently, USC beat UCLA in a dynamic football game with a score of 50-0. Since that all my professors have been raving about what an amazing game that was. The one experience I will always remember is going to the football games and enjoying the camaraderie with all the students. The one thing I do hear a lot of from students is the issue of the general education curriculum. Myself included feel that it is not conducive to our overall learning experience and that they only hinder our academic standing because of the level of difficulty.\", \"USC is the best school in the universe because you get so much for your money. First, there's the fact that it's located in beautiful, sunny Southern California. Who doesn't want to go to a school where it's 70 degrees year-around? Then there's the fact that it's located close to everything you want to be close to as a young adult. There's the numerous glistening beaches, Hollywood, dozens of world-class theatres, Disneyland, the list goes on and on. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the school itself, USC is the perfect balance of academic and social opportunities. That probably has something to do with the fact that the campus--when compared to other big name schools--is relatively small. Only a square mile essentially, the campus size allows for a homey, intimate feel. Every day on campus, I see at least one person I know in passing, which is something that you don't get at bigger schools. USC only has about 30,000 students (including grad students), so it's very likely that you run into friends all the time! And that's something that's important in feeling that you belong at a school. Since my time here began nearly 4 years ago, I have never once questioned my place at USC. Socially, USC has countless clubs to get involved in, as well as an active Greek Community, which about 1/3 of the student body participates in. There's also USC's fabled sports teams, which are a HUGE deal at this school. USC is a football school, and even if you aren't into football coming in, you will certainly be converted come Game Day! The experience of being on campus during a USC football game is indescribable, and is something that you definitely don't want to miss!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I tell people that I go to USC, they are automatically impressed because they know what it takes to get into SC, and they know the kind of education that I am getting. This is something that definitely comes in handy when it comes time to get a job!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile USC is a dream school for countless reasons, it should be noted that USC is not in a quintessential college town. So, if that is something you want, USC may not be the school for you. It's located in the heart of LA, which means it is in an urban environment. Obviously, this comes with its unique set of challenges. The campus is so beautiful though that it is easy to forget where you are. That is, until you hear sirens and helicopters every day, and then you remember. Bu some of the best colleges in the nation--Duke, North Carolina, Yale, and USC of course--are in...less than ideal locations. It's just something that you learn to adapt to in going to school here, but it is definitely safe nonetheless. The thing that living in an urban community allows one to do is experience what real life is beyond the bubble of comfort that most USC kids grow up in. Plus, I always say that if celebs and CEOs of Fortune-500 companies have no problems sending their kids here, than I shouldn't worry about going here either!\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to USC is worth living in a sketchy environment for 4 years. trust me.\", 'The best thing about USC is... Well I don\\'t even know where to start... It could be the fierce Trojan pride and spirit, or the amazing SoCal weather and beautiful brick buildings, or it could be the brilliant and driven people I\\'ve found here.  The undergrad class itself is large, about 18,000 students but the campus still feels intimate.  The sizes of my classes have also been great, except for when they are GEs or general electives.  These are classes that every student must take to have a well rounded individual, but if there were one thing I could change about these classes it would be the size.  Most of them are very interesting besides this.  When I tell people I go to USC they are always impressed, it is after all ranked as the 23rd school in the nation (tied with Carnegie Mellon).  I am also very proud to go here.  I spend most of my time on campus in the Campus Center, where all of the food is.  I\\'ll admit it,, I\\'m a foodie!  And the stuff there is delicious, plus its a very social atmosphere where I can sit when my friends and relax.  Also, I love the older libraries like Doheny.  The big inside study room looks like it came out of Harry Potter!  I wouldn\\'t call downtown LA  a \"college town\" by any means, but we have made the area around the school our own.  I always feel safe, but also never go anywhere alone at night.  Be smart!  USC is also only minutes away from great beach spots and the fantastic Staples Center and LA Live complex so there is plenty to do.      ', 'When the average American hears the word \"USC,\" images of football often rise up first in their minds. It is true that USC is a big sport school. A huge part of our campus culture revolves around our football team, and game days are always crazy, with current students and alumni alike celebrating all over campus. Another common stereotype is that USC is loaded with rich kids. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, both stereotypes are very limiting and misleading. While USC does embrace its sports culture, the school also boasts its already strong and still growing academic strength. Music is also popular here, with weekly live music on campus, and aspiring musicians holding events throughout the year. Visions and Voices hosts a plethora of arts, music, and literary events, with world-renowned speakers, artists, musicians, and authors. USC Spectrum is another organization that hosts a number of art/music-related events. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stereotype that USC is filled with rich and spoiled kids is completely false and misleading. While the school does have a number of well-off students, there is definitely not a \"rich-society\" culture. In any class, you can find students from all walks of life. I\\'ve personally met students that were very well-off and students who were depending entirely on financial aid. With almost 3,000 students matriculating each year, it\\'s impossible to have a homogenous student population. You can find people from all walks of life here. ', \"In terms of university level undergrad education, pretty much every school is the same, you get out what you put in. You have to look at individual professors, some are good some are bad you just have to deal with it, like the fact that you can't always choose your boss. USC has some pretty good majors like cinema, business, music., journalism, engineering Once I got out of school it's not necessarily not what you know (but grades are important) but who you know in terms of getting your self on track for a career post-college. And USC's alumni are well known for treating their fellow trojans well in terms of helping them find a job and such so that is definitely a boon for the University. There are many different kind of people at the school, including yuppie go getters and burnt-out hipsters so you'll be able to find a group of friends that has similar interests to your own, and if not you will find something that interests yourself. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I would change: price of tuition (I think currently colleges are overpriced due to how the loan system is set up, but that's a story for another day), location is not great, students interact with others but are self segregating (cultural changes are hard to adjust).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReputation: In southern california USC has a really good reputation people are generally impressed that you go to the school. Sometimes if you go elsewhere like the east coast they won't really have any sort of opinion.\\r\\n\", \"USC is the perfect size: it's just big enough where you can maintain a certain sense of anonymity but small enough that you always feel a tangible support system around you. You always run into friends on campus and recognize faces in your classes but you can still run to the University Village, Ralphs, or the Lot in your sweatpants without any concern.\\nFurthermore, everything you need is on or near campus, from Chipotle to Superior (grocery store) to Traddies (the on-campus bar) and everything in between. The opportunities are continuing to expand, as well, thanks to a strong administration who cares deeply about their students and actually listens to them. The Trojan Family is not a myth; the loyalty and camaraderie that defines it are evident in every aspect of USC.\", \"USC is incredible.  The administration (though a little politically conservative) spoils its students with brilliant/accessible professors, incredible opportunities to get involved, and personal attention. In my environmental science class we went to USC's campus on Catalina Island, and went snorkeling, sea kayaking, and learned about the island's ecosystem.  It was beautiful.\", '20 years ago USC was known as the \"university of spoiled children\" and \"university of second choice\", now it is the fastest rising school in the country based on rankings and has also been featured on princeton review\\'s list of \"top 10 dream schools\", and this forward momentum doesn\\'t seem to be slowing down. so props to president sample and the administration for turning this school around! \\n\\nCampus: It\\'s relatively small for so many students and during breaks between classes the campus can seem very crowded. I wish the campus was bigger and had more open green space- a rarity in LA. EVK food sucks, parkside food is better.\\n\\nI would change the location of the school, although living in central LA is pretty convenient \"broader experience\"\\n\\nAnd make USC cheaper, 50k+ a year is a lot of money', \"One thing I'd change: Nothing.\\nSize: Perfect. Big enough that you meet tons of people who are interested in all different things but small enough you actually get to know people. Class size is a mix between lectures with 100 or so students to more intimate classes with maximums of 20. Most large lectures have an accompanying discussion section with only 20 or so students.\\nWhen I tell people I go to USC, they usually hate on it a little bit. It's a good school academically but also athletically and people tend to be resentful because we win a lot!\\nI spend most time on campus either in the dorms (this isn't true for everyone...it really depends if you get in a good dorm, if people there are social, etc), the Row, the quad, etc.\\nNo college town really. The area surrounding the campus is pretty sketch, but, that being said, the campus itself feels safe. While there is no traditional college town, we're in the middle of downtown LA and people go out and explore on weekends. We'll hit up Manhattan beach on the weekends or go to the Grove for lunch.\\nSO MUCH SCHOOL PRIDE. Everyone loves it here. Everyone. From freshmen on their first day to seniors on graduation day to alumni fifty years later.\", \"USC is incredible. The best part about USC is that you are in LA which allows you SO many opportunities you wouldn't get at another school, while still giving you a (gorgeous) campus feel. For me, the school is a little small, however I seem to be in the minority. Everyone loves the size and honestly- for anyone who is worried that it is too big- the campus is so close that you will never walk to class without seeing someone you know! The one thing I would change is the lack of an immediate college town, however you still get the Row which always has something going on if you want to go out, as well as the 90. And the surrounding community is NOT as bad as everyone makes it out to be. The school pride is incredible, and the Trojan Family really is so strong and will definitely prove helpful when you are looking for a job.\", \"USC is not one unified school, but is, rather, a collection of the smaller pre-professional schools that comprise it. While I can only speak as a former student of the School of Theatre, the SOT had serious administrative problems and has been losing a large number of theatre majors (who usually switch to minors in favor of more popular majors such as Business or Comm) because of the lack of direction offered by advisors and by the poor quality of the lower-division classes. USC's reputation has outgrown its academic prowess, which desperately needs to catch up.\", \"There is an immense amount of pride at USC.  People love going to school here.  We love the fact that the University is well above average in every aspect of the collegiate experience.  The best thing about USC is that we party all the time (especially on the row) and still manage to have great academic programs with a very diverse student body and wonderful professors.  The school is without a doubt well rounded.  I couldn't imagine a school more well rounded than USC.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say that being in South Central LA is a bit unnerving.  The area around us is not the best, and I get asked for money about 5 times a day.  I've had people ask me for money when I am ordering at drive-thrus.  It gets annoying and you have to be careful, but thats life in a big city.\", \"Among my friends, if we could do college over again and had the choice of ANY college in the country, we would still commit to SC in a heartbeat. It is really rare to find a school so well balanced; we have incredible faculty but we also have a great football team; we have a vibrant Greek system and at the same time there are plenty of organizations to join if you don't want to get involved there. \\r\\n\\r\\nI'll start with why I love USC, and then I will go into its drawbacks. First and foremost, the school spirit here is AMAZING and lasts for the rest of your life. No matter where you go in the world, if you are a Trojan you are part of the family. You will have job opportunities, friendships, and other relationships that would never exist but for your membership in the Trojan family. I have experienced it countless times, from meeting an alum while on a community service trip in Ghana to finding a great internship through the alumni network. Many schools brag about alumni networks, but I have heard MANY times (through both USC and non-USC alums) that the Trojan network is simply unparalleled. To me, the meaning of this is more than just knowing it will be easier to find a job. It's really about feeling like you are part of a camaraderie- wherever I end up in the world, I know there will be people that have something in common with me and will greet me with open arms. Another thing I like about SC is that the size is perfect- it's not so small that you feel like you're living in a gossipy small town, but it's not so large that you feel like nothing but a number. Politically, I also think there is quite a good balance between liberal and conservative supporters. People sometimes think USC is very conservative, but I think they say that because we are just more conservative than the average college campus- overall, however, I would say the student body is more liberal than conservative.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the bad... the first thing that comes to my mind is that we are not in a college town in any sense of the word. Frankly, we are in the ghetto. There are no cute boulevards with shops and restaurants, no streets with college bars. In fact, we really only have two bars: one on campus and one down the street. EVERYONE goes to those two. Surprisingly, though, my friends and I didn't really mind not living in a college town- the food around here is cheap and places like Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Manhattan Beach are all very close. I guess we just saved money. Another thing I didn't like about USC was that it was pretty dead on the weekends, particularly as a freshman in the dorms. While we have a great many students that don't live in southern California, many do, and they often go home on the weekends. That said, if you make friends with people who don't leave you will be fine.\", \"USC seeks to expose its students to as much as possible; therefore, we have more international students than any school in the U.S., the school offers a relatively enormous amount of majors/minors, and encourages students to study seemingly disparate fields using scholarship incentives. We have a lot of top-rated schools at USC which makes it easy to pursue a diverse set of interests (from Film to Business/Accounting to Engineering to Music to Communications: these are among the very best in the country). Because USC has so many good schools in so many different areas, and because USC gives so much in Financial Aid, you'll find that wherever your interests lie, there is probably a decent following of similar-minded people.\", \"It was my life's dream to go to USC film school but I would say the experience, wholly, was a disappointment. There are many unfair rituals that take place at USC; you WILL get black-listed from certain events, scholarships, directing opportunities, if you raise your voice about ANYTHING; or complain about anything. I once complained about how poorly sound people were treated on a USC-funded class (CTPR 546) and I was NEVER able to get a sound SA-ship afterwards. I was more than qualified but the positions kept being given to people who were not of my caliber and who, in certain instances, turned their application weeks after the deadline. After this incident took place, I shut my mouth, which is afterall what the school wanted me to do. \\r\\nIf you're a lesbian you will do really well at the Film school as the heads of many divisions are open lesbians. Several semesters in a row 546 were directed by lesbian women and also contained lesbian-themed films. Nothing wrong with this of course, just another factor about USC that I think is worth noting. \\r\\nScholarships are completely unfair, I mean COMPLETELY! They are not judged by a panel of unbiased observers, and the applications are NOT anonymous as they should be, but instead the applications are judged by USC professors who undoubtedly give the scholarship to their favorite students. For example, a friend of mine just recently won a scholarship for comedic-writing, for which he did not even apply for. This was an award listed on the General Scholarship application, many students applied, whole-heartedly. Their application was not even read, because the professor simply handed the award to a student he personally liked. But again, no one can complain without fear of being black-listed.\", 'The best thing about USC is the Trojan Family.  As cliche as it sounds, it\\'s true.  It\\'s not just the fight song chants between drivers with Trojan stickers on the back of the car.  It\\'s the personal encounters between Trojans of all ages.  In fact, just the other day, a man noticed me wearing my USC sweatshirt and stopped me in the middle of the check-out line for Micheals.  He couldn\\'t stop talking about how amazing the school was and what an awesome college experience he had.  By the end of the conversation, he congratulated me multiple times and said, \"If you ever need anything, please let me know!\"  Quite a generous offer from a stranger.', \"USC is an amazing campus in the middle of south central Los Angeles. This makes it feel like a bubble at some times, but also opens the university up to the city's culture. Field trips into downtown and hollywood make up for the bubble effect, and the students who are outgoing benifit from their surroundings.\", \"The best thing about USC is without a doubt the connections you make. There is school pride at USC, you can tell that from the moment you step on campus. Unless you're incredibly antisocial you will go to all the football games freshman year. You meet tons of great people at those games. \\r\\nYou stay on campus a lot freshman year, and it's an assett to have a friend with a car or to have one yourself. You never want to hang out in the area immediately surrounding SC, since it's dangerous, and this is especially true at nighttime. During the day though, I've walked around and never had any problems. Regardless, you never want to walk around the neighborhood by yourself. SC has a DPS (Department of Public Safety) that is very good with notifying the student body about criminal activity in the area, so you're always informed. As long as you use common sense, you will be safe at all times.\", 'USC IS THE PERFECT SCHOOL.  There so many different types of people and everyone\\'s really friendly.  Also, even though students know how to work hard in class, they also know how to have a good time.  A lot of students enjoy the Greek system and party on \"the row\" (where all the Greek houses are located) during the nights and weekends.  During the day, my friends and I love spending time just walking around because the weather is so nice.  USC is big enough that you don\\'t see people you know everywhere, but it\\'s also small enough to walk to most of your classes is 5-10 minutes.  There is SO MUCH school pride, especially during football season because our team is one of the best!', \"There is an enormous amount of diversity at USC, both among the students' backgrounds and academic endeavors. This creates an expansive learning environment, and is one of USC's greatest strengths.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the school is perfectly-sized; you'll frequently encounter people you know, but there are always new faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople seem quite impressed when I tell them I go to USC. When I mention I'm an Animation major, some are skeptical and others are excited. The skeptics should meet the animation faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an enormous amount of school pride. Some take the rivalry with UCLA a little too far, in my opinion, but as long as you're not harming anyone or being rude, it's all good fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are new Cinematic Arts and Commons/Sudent Center buildings under construction, pretty exciting!\", \"USC is an incredible place to go to school, with rich history, great academics, and amazing sports.  The campus is beautiful and very unique for a large university.  Although USC can seem really big, the classes are moderate in size freshmen year, and can be very small in major classes.  Some of my accounting classes had about 15 students in some sections.  USC can feel very small, you will see people you know everyday and because most people are really involved with greek life, clubs, sports etc. the campus becomes really small.  USC is making a lot of changes very fast, to become one of the top universities in the world.  Basically, President Sample, wants to compete with the ivy leagues and everyone at USC knows thats his intentions (although it's hard to fathom becoming an ivy league).  New buildings are already being built really fast, including the new George Lucas building at the film school, and the new student commons center which will have a huge cafeteria area and new student study areas and campus organization rooms.  The administration is amazing at USC, I can literally walk in anytime to the business or accounting school counselors and just sit down and talk with them, and they have a lot of time to spend one-on-one discussing your classes, major, and goals for jobs and grad school.  Also, most professors are very well connected and great with getting you internships, jobs, and reccomendation letters.  USC definitely has a network that no other school has, and it has been the best part about going to the school.  Many of my internships I have received because I am a trojan.\", 'USC is a decent sized school. We have approx. 32000 students but the campus is too small to accomodate the population. USC does have large introductory classes but it gets better once you move into the upper level classes. \\r\\nUSC is in a bad part of Los Angeles, but fortunately, it\\'s located about 3 miles south of downtown. Downtown LA is becoming a more popular place to live and play so it\\'s good that it\\'s so close...especially if you\\'re going to a Lakers game or a concert at Staples. \\r\\nOf course, when people hear that I go to USC, they automatically say its other name---University of Spoiled Children. Again, we do have a lot of rich kids who go hear, but you see that at any school, especially private ones. You just have to find your niche on campus. It takes some people the first two weeks of freshman year or you may have to wait until sophomore year to find it. \\r\\nPeople are really proud about being a Trojan, which is something that everyone is supposed to have. Recruiters try to sell USC as an opportunity to join the Trojan family. It\\'s true, but I\"m waiting until one of my Trojan family members can help me find a job after graduation.\\r\\nIn the next two years, USC is building a new campus center that can rival our rival\\'s campus center. It should be great.', 'The big picture of USC is set within the context of Los Angeles, which can be overwhelming and graffiti gray at first. People say you need a car to get around, which is partly true but I have also gotten around fine in public transportation (others may disagree).  Having a car can actually make the city blander once you\\'ve been to the main attractions a billion times. The happiest I have been has been without a car, \"stuck\" on campus. If you find the right people, all you need is that island called campus, with occasional short boat rides off, for a good experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think we generally do things right here, mostly because I can\\'t of any complaints. The most activism on campus has been from groups claiming SC\\'s clothing is from sweatshops but the facts are mostly against them. the group is a joke. We\\'re a Green campus (meaning environmental), healthy food choices everywhere, and pretty savvy technology. \\r\\n\\r\\nSchool Pride is SC and it is shown on gameday. Admittedly, it is not as much as the the midwest, but you definitely see people representing cardinal and gold all across Southern California. Anyone who likes football in Los Angeles but isn\\'t willing to low themselves to be Raiders fans roots for SC. In my opinion there are more Trojan fans in CA than Bruin fans...but there are also more Trojan Haters than Bruin Haters. People hate this school 1.) because we win 2.) because we\\'re private and affluent and 3.) because of allegations of bribing athletes to come here', \"When I tell people I go to USC, they are shocked and excited because they know it is very difficult to get into the school escpeciall with my major. I spend most of my time at the music school with all my classes and I work at the Thornton School of music office of Admissions. I wish that the amount of partying would go down and that students would get in more trouble for the stuff they do that they shouldn't do.\", \"USC is like the college experience in movies. Its true. Fraternity row is world-renowned (its true) and houses from other schools come to visit whenever they can because of how great the dynamic is on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night. If you're really torn between SC and another school, come to a football game. Even if you hate the sport, you'll come away sold on the school, throwing up a fight on, and chanting the fight song. It happens to everyone. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university's alumni system is no joke. The Trojan Family is something you'll hear thrown around a lot, but it actually is one of the best things about the school, I swear. Since freshman year, my peers and I have been getting calls from recruiters asking if we want interviews. (Think Disney, E & Y, and Nestle.) The preparation the school gives you the 'next step' is unparalleled this side of the Mississippi. USC grads run LA as it truly is a 'professional' university with alumni who fight for their companies' recruiting classes to be filled with Trojans. I kid you not, I would posit that 80% of my peers had job offers at professional forms for the summer SOPHMORE year by April, meanwhile my friends at other schools were still wondering if their usual spot at Macy's would be available.\", \"it's kinda hard to make friends at first just because there are soooo many people...also the classes tend to be a lot larger too so it's hard to really get to know your professors, but there are ways to work through things like that.  overall, the whole atmosphere here is amazing, generally everyone is very nice and sociable.  the sports are amazing, especially football...and basically if you're looking for a party, you'll find one...or seven :)\", 'USC is an awesome school. Anything you want to do or learn about can be done at USC. Being in L.A., this means that any kind of food you want to eat any kind of show you want to see is 20 minutes away from your dorm (without traffic, lol). When you tell people in L.A. that you go to USC they automatically say \"damn, that\\'s a good school.\" People are nicer to you when you say you go to USC. They ask you do you go to football games? What\\'s it like going there? Etc. Being from Texas where a lot of people think USC stands for University of South Carolina, I was shocked by how much prestige USC has in Southern California. There is a ton of school pride at USC and you will feel it the first time you attend a football tailgate on campus. People who went to SC\\' a million years ago show up to BBQ and party before the game. At the Coliseum people paint their bodies and yell until they loose their voices. You\\'ll  find yourself high-fiveing people you just met 10 minutes ago. The Alumni network is so great, especially if you are a business student. Companies in every field recruit SC\\' students. Graduating from SC\\' gets you a lot of perks.', \"USC is an amazing school, no doubt about it. The best thing about USC is the feeling of being a part of the Trojan Family. No matter where you go there is always someone there who can say they went through the same experiences you have gone through. The campus is beautiful and we are often in all the television shows and movies. From my opinion the only people who react negatively when telling them you go to USC are rival schools like Notre Dame, and the top UC schools. Many react to the stereotype that USC students are snotty brats and don't deserve what we have. This is completely false. The USC administration does a great job at handling and dealing with the students. USC has thee most school pride on the West Coast with out a doubt, and is right up there with the SEC schools of the South. Not many complaints when living in this perfect environment.\", \"The best thing about USC is the connections you make with people in your chosen field. The campus is nice--an island in a ghetto--and I feel completely safe here. However, USC could use its space a little more efficiently--many classes have to use spare spaces at the cafes. The gym isn't big enough. The film school is crammed, but that is being fixed by the new George Lucas building that's being built. \\r\\nThe school pride here is insane--and infectious. I especially love how hardcore the marching band is. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe internet at this school is not very good. It's often down, and the connection is weak in the dorms. I had a particularly bad experience, as I had no internet working for half a year, and the ITS and Housing people couldn't get it together (bureaucracy....). The internet works just fine in the classrooms, though.\", 'USC is what you make of it. It is stocked with outstanding faculty who have joined the world of educators via successful careers. It has talented kids who will change their respective fields. But it also has a bunch of spoiled, privileged brats (and lower-middle class pretenders, like me) who look the part, who walk the walk, and should be ignored.', 'USC\\'s location in the middle of thriving downtown Los Angeles is a large reason why so many students choose to come here.  Any big city has much to offer for university students, but Los Angeles especially is so diverse and huge that it\\'s easy for the students to get off campus and go something fun for the weekend. Everyone in LA recognizes SC; it\\'s cool when you can walk around Olvera Street or Little Tokyo and somebody will shout out a \"Fight On!\" in your direction.  \\r\\nSo many people think that USC is in such a bad location and that the area is just too dangerous.  However, we have a Department of Public Safety for the USC campus only, as well as USC specific LAPD officers on campus all the time, and we have a fire department right across the street.  The campus and surrounding areas are all well lit, and as on any college campus, if you\\'re smart, you\\'re safe. \\r\\nUSC thrives on school pride. We bleed cardinal and gold, we have The Greatest Marching Band in the History of the Universe, the World Famous Song Girls, 87 NCAA National Championships, as well as 7 Heisman Trophy winners. What\\'s not to be proud of ?', \"I love USC.  The School of Engineering is amazing.  It's like a small school within a big school.  Students are really involved and love being here.  The professors will help you with anything.  There's one professor who will regularly stay in his office until 4am to help his students finish their homework.  Los Angeles is a great place to go to college.  There's the beach, Disneyland, and Hollywood all nearby.  There is a ton of school pride.  Football season is a very big deal.\", 'The best things about USC are the student\\'s pride and unity. If I had to change one thing it would be very minor. I would change the fact that student\\'s can only pay for food with their USC card account or cash. I would make the food courts accept credit cards as well, which is the most convenient form of payment. I believe the size of the school is just right. It is large enough where you can meet a large array of people and small enough that you get to learn the people in your major. When I tell people I go to USC I normally get a very positive reaction and comments such as, \"you must be smart!\" Most of my time in campus is spent in the classroom, however, during my breaks I can usually be found in the computer lab of Leavey Library or on a bench drinking coffee. USC is not really located in a \"college town,\" but resides in the center of metropolitan Los Angeles. My opinion on the school\\'s administration is mostly positive. I have come across only one or two professors who were not benefical or helpful. There is a huge amount of school pride! One can not walk around campus without seeing hundreds of USC sweatshirts and lisence plate holders. I do not hear many complaints from other students. The only complaining I hear is of midterms and papers, which can be heard at every college across the world!', \"USC has everything--academics, atheltics, and a great social life.

I feel like every single student at this school loves it and loves being here. This gives the school such a sense of pride and community that is rare to find.

It took me too long to completely understand how much higher the level of academic competition is now in college and how many more doors are opened if I push myself to work as hard as I possibly can.\\nThe last thing I would tell myself is to grasp every opportunity possible, whether it be academic or social.', \"I would tell my high school self that everyone feels out of place and homesick during the first month or two of college, and that it's okay to feel that way. Feeling homesick doesn't mean you don't love college. It just means you're adjusting. It wasn't until second semester that my friends and I were able to look back and laugh that we were all feeling the exact same way, and were all hiding it from each other,  terrified of anyone finding out we missed home. I would also tell myself that the friends you'll make in college will be well worth the fear you felt in the first few weeks.\", 'The high school student I was and the graduate student I am today are completely different personalities and people. I don’t know if I would have been very receptive to any advice as a high school student because of my stubborn and crass nature.  Conversely, I wouldn’t want to advise myself at that fragile time because I would have undoubtedly changed the path I lived through, possibly for worst. Any advice I would have given would have altered who I am today. In my life thus far, becoming successful has been entirely dependent on learning valuable lessons from my past mistakes. And if not for the mistakes made in high school, I wouldn’t have grown into the person I am currently. With that being noted, I would give myself little to no advice. I would, however, encourage myself to have stronger faith in my abilities, thoughts, and to reject the idea that I didn’t have any self worth.  I’m confident that advice would be sufficient enough. Giving myself that little bit of encouragement would have served to improve my self esteem and prepare me for the rigors of life, from then onward.', \"College isn't something to be afraid of. Now that I'm in college, I can truly say that I am having the best time of my life; my friends who  constantly surround you push you to achieve things you never thought you could before purely because they want you to succeed. Don't get me wrong, college is a billion times harder than high school, but the one thing that makes it all worth it is the environment you're in. I stay up until 3AM because I want to understand the material, I want to pursue my dream, and I want to prove to myself that I am 100% capable of achieving my goals. And as an added bonus, everyone around you is doing the exact same thing; we all have different passions and goals, but we all have a similar drive to get to that finish line. College is a learning and growing process; you get what you make of it, so find your passion, find your drive, and only then can you take control of your life and lead yourself to find the best in you and make the most out of life.\", \"If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior I would advice myself to take AP Biology online. I have always loved the sciences and now in college I am majoring in Human Biology, but going from high school to college science classes was a big transition. When I took my first biology class in USC I was not prepared for the class at all. I found it rather challenging and complicated, while other students that took AP Biology in high school passed the class with flying colors. I knew that if I would have taken AP Biology in high school I would have been better prepared and would have not struggled as much. I had to go through a whole semester to adjust to the college science classes, a semester that wasn't easy at all. I would always hear other students say how easy the class was because most of the things they learned  were the same as AP Biology, but I couldn't compare this biology class to the biology class I took in highschool. I just told myself that STUDYING was the key to passing the class.\", \"I would definitely say learn how to cook easy/quick/cheap meals. Also, apply for a ton of scholarships so you don't have to worry about money while you're there. But look forward to it!\", '\"Take a break and open your mind.\" That was the phrase teachers always told me in high school, but I never listened. Ironically, these are probably the words I would tell myself in retrospect. A problem that many high school seniors (including myself) have is hubris--we all think we know what\\'s best for the world. Though this attitude is great and partially the reason why people in college are so exciting to be around, it is dangerous in that we start to shut out others. We would all like to think that we know what\\'s best for everyone, but really the best step towards progress is cooperation. Yes, every college campus seems to have a million problems with it once you pass the \"I\\'m in college!\" stage, but that doesn\\'t mean you can solve everything. Take into account others\\' views and take time to decide whether something is worth spending time and effort to change. If you decide it\\'s not, that\\'s alright. Go take a break and enjoy college before it passes. I have a feeling this ride\\'s going faster than high school!', 'I\\'m not going to say the obvious things everybody else is going to tell you, like \"it\\'s hard to adjust to dorm life\", \"you\\'ll be eaten alive in college classes so study hard\", or even \"just be yourself\"; by avoiding those cliche words of advice I\\'m implying that you\\'ll already have those things taken care of. What I think is most important is that you establish yourself as strong entity amongst the people you meet: your friends, your classmates, professors, everyone. That is, you should have a strong sense of who you are, and what you want others to see you as. If people remember you and your personality, they will be much more open to any ideas you present as well as be more likely to help you when you find yourself in difficult situations. Also, you should get yourself exposed to as many people as you can, to increase the chances of finding people who will further whatever motives you have. With so much competition out there, it helps to have a good block of people who can back you up and help you get where you want to be.', 'When I went to college, I had to handle the transition socially and academically. In high school, my friends were everything, but in college, I was forced to start all new relationships. It’s important not to panic or get discouraged about trying to meet new people and make connections, but remember that everyone is in the same situation. You will feel tempted to give in to just anyone, but do not settle. Make sure you choose friends who you can have fun with, but also who will make you a better person. Academically, my biggest regret is not studying for my first midterm. Naturally, I was not used to the heavy amount of material on one exam and did not understand the many hours necessary to dedicate to studying; I received an F on that first midterm. If I could go back and change one thing, I would study for that test. I learned that it is easier to just study from the beginning, rather than trying to catch up the entire semester. While the transition from high school to college is difficult, college is the time to grow and discover who you really are as a person.', \"Join a club of your interest and invest in it.

I never took advantage of them, and I truly regret that now. It is also a must, that you get a job and have a source of income. With a new salary, you not only increase your net-worth, but you also gain appreciation of your possessions as well as a heightened sense of the value of a dollar. Before I got a job, I abused my parents’ money, but now I appreciate my possessions way more because I had to work hard for them. It is also a great feeling to treat yourself to some new items of clothing every once in a while. Lastly, live the college life to the fullest. It is a privilege that many kids your age do not have the opportunity to experience because of familial or economic drawbacks that prevent them from doing so. Venture out of your comfort zone and meet new friends.

Having only experienced a semester of college, I have extensively grown and matured intellectually and psychologically. During finals week I received some very unfortunate news. My 24 year old sister had been diagnosed with cancer. This event proved to me that life can be hard and blunt and the way that you handle such situations can ultimately determine your success. College midterms and final exams may be hard but it is a precursor to real life experiences. It is important that you keep your goals in mind even if it seems you're not getting any further in achieving them. If you remain strong and stay true to yourself when presented with any obstacle you can only succeed. You only fail when you give up. Although I had to deal with my sister's condition, I also had to keep in mind that my education will determine my future. I had to stay strong for my sister's sake but I also had to stay true to myself by continuing my studies.\", \"I would advise myself to listen to the advice given to all high school seniors about the college transition.  I thought, as most did as seniors, that college life would not be difficult to adjust to, but it is a great change.  The advice I received that was most applicable to me was regarding time management.  Time in college is much less structured, creating the illusion of more free time.  However, this open time should be used for studying and staying up on your classes.  When you fall behind in a college class, it is much more difficult to catch up.  Joining clubs is a great way to make friends with common interests and get a group of friends outside of those you live with.  The most important piece of advice I could give myself is to make sure to relax with some regularity.  It is easy to go crazy focusing on school and the work you need to do, but if you don't take a break from it, you will burn out.  College is supposed to be enjoyable as well as difficult, so make sure you are enjoying what you are doing.\"])\n",

In actuality, less than 30% of students are involved in greek life, I think that they are just the loudest, and are obnoxious about it. There are plenty of other groups on campus, not the mention the amazing Thornton School of Music which attracts lots of students whose interests delve deeper than partying and looking good.

USC also caters to a large international student student body. We are one of the most diverse campuses in southern California and use that diversity to excel academically.

However, the student population is far too large and diverse to be stereotyped as one certain thing. Although there are some people who are clearly very wealthy, such as minor celebrities or children of celebrities, there are students from all different backgrounds. This stereotype might have been more true in the past, USC is changing to become more diverse. For example, this year is the first year that USC has both QuestBridge and Posse Scholars, two programs aimed at helping low income students succeed in college, which shows how this stereotype is changing.

While that may have been true years ago, USC is definitely not that school today. It started when recently retired USC President Steven Sample took over in 1991. He made it his goal to revitalize the image of USC, and he was very successful in doing so. Today, USC is a Top-25 university, and features an array of schools that rank in the Top-10 for their respective programs. For example, the USC School of Cinematic Arts is the best film school in the country. Not only that, but it is also the hardest school in the country to get into.

More than half of the students at SC receive some form of financial aid for need-based reasons. Of course, since USC does cost over $50,000 a year, there are many wealthy kids that go here, but socio-economics are not something that the students focus on.

Furthermore, almost everyone in our chapter is wealthy.
