In all my courses my coursemates and I were able to form a family-like atmosphere and bond as if we have known one another all our lives. I am more than positive that there are a few lifetime friendships that are established. The Christian base core of the university is a robust contribution to the warmth and tranquility that exist on campus and amongst the students and staff. \n\nThe course design-challenged ones' cognitive capacity in providing information that is beneficial and will enable the student to react in a natural capacity when handling difficult situations. The assignments geared each student to think rationally and just when engaged in mediation or defusing conflict. The scenarios are as close to mimicking the actual situation that occurred as one can construct.  My major is Conflict Management and Resolution."

ACU's staff always ensures that the campus looks stunning to visitors and for the amazing students that come here! ACU students have a very family like vibe to them that makes anyone that is here visiting feel like they are already a part of the family. On weekends there are quite a few things to do which is surprising for such a small town such as go to the movies or go to the lake. There is always something to find. Academically the school is very challenging which I enjoy. The students that come here are truly here to get a higher education along with the ability to practice there faith however they would like to. There are two things however that I do not like about Abilene Christian University. The first is the food on the weekends. For some reason the food on the weekends that the school provides is never very good quality. The second thing is the price of the school. Unfortunately the school is about double what a public college price would be and it can be pretty draining. But even with those disadvantages, I plan to make Abilene Christian University the college that I attend for the entirety of my college career! Go Wildcats!"

The professors I have had, intentionally get to know me, and have continued to do so, even after I am out of their class. I am constantly being pushed and stretched. I am encouraged to think for myself, and to share my thoughts and ideas with a community. I have grown so much as a person , and also spiritually, at ACU. I have been taught more than just what I need to know for my major, but instead a variety of things, and have been allows to chose classes that interest me and will help me grow. "

Just by stepping on campus, you feel sense of belonging because of the people that go to school hear, teach, work, you name it. Majority of people  on campus welcome you with open arms and are here to be by your side no matter what. That is the one thing that stands out about this school. You cannot beat the people or this town of people. "

The love I have received from other students and professors here is amazing. Although it is like any other college experience, ACU combined the perfect mixture of education with having a Christian lifestyle. Professors integrate how to go into a career with not forgetting to  follow God's plan for you. Currently I am a Convergence Journalism degree here at ACU and my work load is really not that bad. As a student here at ACU, you are required to have 55 chapel credits a semester, take Bible courses (it depends on your major on how many),  and you must live on campus for at least two years. Depending on your major or certain classes, you might have to incorporated community service hours. Also, tuition's is a whooping $40,000 a year, but with a good GPA or ACT from high school, ACU is typically giving of scholarships and grants. Minus those, ACU is a good size community where everyone watches out for one another. The ACU Police Department is always around on rotations and do their best to make you feel protected as a student attending here. You can know the professors on an intimate level. Overall, the students and faculty on ACU's campus are very friendly and are always caring. I have made wonderful memories and friends here while attending Abilene Christian University and I hope to grow even more in the next four years attending this campus. "

Some of the students and faculty are friendly but not all. Classes aren't that hard if you go to class and do the work. It isn't a party school either.

The professors want to see their students engaged and present in the lecture. My favorite class is my Management class with Dr. Vardiman. He has many words of wisdom that he shares with the class. It is a challenging class but it is not impossible to make an A in his class. My least favorite class is my biology class. I don't like the way that the class is set up.

He's just going to keep doing what he's doing, so break up with him and date Chris so you won't have any regrets. Some more advice for your, my, last year: don't get so stressed, it'll all work out in the end. When you're buying things for your dorm room, don't go overboard.

Next, I would say, be 100% confident in who you are and don't change for other people. Having experienced freshman year of college, I know it is so easy to let your self-assurance dwindle, and before you know it, you've lost who you are in the crowd and noise of those around you.

Secondly, I would tell myself to spend a lot more time with family because I do not get to see them near as often now. In addition, I would also advise spending more time with my friends, because again, I do not get to see them near as often as I would like. Finally, I would warn myself about the difficulties of adjusting to the new college life style.

I would encourage her not to get down on herself anymore and to realize that she has a whole lot of potential. More over, that people will actually recognize this potential and talent and will be willing to work with her. I would tell her to be more open to try to be more social. I would tell her that everyone has their own story and own difficulty that they are dealing with. I would tell her that being a B average is more than okay. That not everyone can make straight A's adn that everyone is not expecting her to do just. If I could go back and tell myself this, things would be diffrent and probably in a good way.

I was involved with my community only through National Honor Society and Lions Club, but I wish I took the opportunities from my local church to help those in need. Now being in college, I see how community service taught me work ethic and I wish I had done more so I could have established better relationships with the people I worked with. I wish I went out of my comfort zone to help and connect with more people, rather than working at the same charities and food banks.

First, I would tell myself to keep my grades up because it makes a huge difference at the end of high school.  For example, grades can affect what colleges you get accepted into, which scholarships you can apply for and how much you receive from those scholarships. Secondly, I would encourage myself to save as much money as possible so that I do not have to stress about it during college. Lastly, I would advise myself to make the best of college by studying hard, making great memories, and building friendships along the way.

You'll be pleased to hear that your easily a member of at least three of these groups by the end of the year! Now finally, and perhaps most importantly, don't let welcome week stress you out.

When you go away for college, you have to rely on yourself to get things done, such as cleaning dishes or doing laundry. I would also remind my senior self to reflect on who I really am. It is easy to conform to others around you in hopes of fitting in, but in the long run, you won't be happy. The key to enjoying life is to be yourself.

It was in large part due to these aforementioned relationships, that I was reluctant to begin a new part of my life in college. The first year that I was enrolled in my university, I travelled home too frequently to make close friends and build meaningful relationships. If I could give my high school senior self some advice, it would be to wholeheartedly invest in the people and communities in the university, without completely neglecting my high school ones. Fortunately, I learned this lesson after my first year, and I was able to thoroughly enjoy my time in college. However, I missed out on a lot of new adventures with vibrant college freshman because I was afraid of losing the friends I had attained previously in high school. If I could give my seventeen-year-old self advice about going to college, it would be to live fully in the present, while learning from, and not forgetting, the past.",
                "Claire": "I've got news for you. College isn't as difficult as you think. You've always been good at school, and that won't change. My advice to you is to not let the academic facet swallow you whole. It's important: after all that's what you'll be paying for. But academics aren't anything. You need to spend time with friends too. During the first few weeks of school, all you'll want to do is to study because of your fear of messing up this amazing opportunity. But this is the most crucial time to make new friends and build connections. If you're holed up in your dorm room with only your textbooks for company, you'll have a difficult time finding people to hang out with because everyone will have already found their niche. You're allowed to spend time just having fun with friends because college will be over before you know it. The most memorable parts will be those fun times you had with friends, not all the nights you stayed in with the books. Don't study constantly: you'll do great. Just don't forget to have fun.",

Do not be scared of what college may bring, be excited. Remember that this is the best time of your life, do not take advantage of the coming years. It is hard to be away from your family, if you move away, but you gain the independence of doing things for yourself and making your own decisions. Do go home and visit those who love you and let them see how good of a job they did raising you.",

Don't take Mrs. Davidson for granted. Most of all, take your SATS and ACTs. Go to a doctor about your anxieties, get help ealier. Get good grades, so you can get into any college you want after Butler. You need to know that college is better, but it's not easy. You have to listen, you have to study. You have to turn things in on time. You have to devote yourself to school, not just work. School is important for what you want to do, because you can't ever do it unless you have a degree. It's gonna be difficult but you'll make it through, and you'll thank me for pushing you through it all.",

I know right now you have your sights set on becoming a mechanical engineer but listen, you have to rethink this decision. Look at me, you're future self, I'm not an engineer, I ended up switching to political science and honestly it's the best decision I made. Dad's right, listen to him, he sees what you don't, what I didn't. Before you go off and apply for engineering look at your grades, they're all geared to poli. sci. and you'll do great.\n\nI also want you to know one thing, mom is going to snap, she's going to be very unsupportive, but listen,  if you have a problem you're going to have resources and people to help you, dad is gonna be one of them.\n\nOh, and when you meet Tara don't play it safe, just go ahead and ask her out.",

Even though I had to go through some rather difficult times in my home life and grow up a lot quicker than most people my age, which was 17 at the time I graduated at started college, it was all worth it. I would tell myself not to lose hope or give up, because no matter how hard it seems it does get better. I would also say to forgive those who hurt you the most, but even more importantly to forgive yourself. To relize that there is only so much you can control and to leave the rest to God. To continue to grow and learn, and allways have a servents heart for those around you.  And I think the most important thing I would say to myself is to love the life you were given, because it is beautiful and their are people who love you just the way you are.

I would say that even though my high school friends are great, I will find even better ones in college. I would say to enjoy not having to do homework because next year you will have tons. I would say to save more of my money because in college you will be broke. I would say that, in all honesty, you need to lower your expectations for college because it is nothing like what you see in movies. And I would say that even though college will be nothing like what you expect, it will still be a great adventure of trying to figure out what you want in life and learning to rely on God for everything.",

I know you are super exicted, and nervous but there are few things you need to know things like study habits, and most of all grades/homework. So i know the first year is fun and there are lots of things going on but it would help if you got a study habit in. This helps you balance all the fun and your schoolwork so that way you can maintain the grades you want plus the social life that comes with meeting new people . It will also help you in the long run because college classes just get harder over time. Lastly the homework and grades  is all up to you the parents will not be on your back about getting it done it is all up to you. I know  this sounds crazy but your grades can effect your gpa which counts toward graduaton school. The dorm life is a big transition because you are sharing a building with other people which could be something new to you.",

You are comfortable with how your life currently is, but little do you know how much leaving this comfort zone is going to do for you. Remember learning about Plato's Allegory of the Cave in English? It is applicable to your life right now and you need to expand your horizons because there is so much beauty left in the world for you to see, I know how clich\u00e9. Do not be timid because you will meet people that will change your perspective on life. Be open minded to ideas that you are not familiar with. Be willing to learn from not only your professors, but your peers. Be ready to stay up late studying for quizzes and exams that you know you are not prepared for. Take advantage of \"sleep time\" because you will need all the rest you can get. Eat healthy and stay active because you will not have mom's healthy cooking anymore. Overall, just be ready to experience life in an entirely different way, grow, and feel uncomfortable often; you'll eventually find that discomfort does not always remain umcomfortable.",

Once you get to college, its a whole different world. Its so many exciting people to meet, not all are friendly but most. Think of, how proud mom will be. She always told you that you could do it you cannot let her down. Think of all the new things you'll learn, imagine all the opportunities that furthering your education can bring. I'm telling you this because I know you can do this. I see you're slacking on your work but if you pull through, once you graduate you will feel much better. No, I'm not saying college will be easier but guess what? No more waking up at 5 to be on time, you pick your schedule. You can work, you can join so many clubs. College is the place to be, trust me. So nomore excuses. Pick your head up, get this work done and get yourself prepared. I promise you wont regret it!",
                "Stephanie": "I was completely ready to be off at college; however much of what I experienced made me wish I had done things differently while in high school. Studying is never an option in college. If you choose not to study, you choose to fail the exam. All through high school I studied for tests, but never pushed myself to the fullest. With college exams, you will always need that extra push. Another of my biggest regrets is the use of my time. My senior year of high school I had so much time on my hands that I wasted. I took two dual credit courses to get me ahead in college, but that was it. With all that extra time, I could have taken more and pushed myself to be ahead now. So, my advice for all high school students would be to take full use of your time. You do not have to take extra classes, but do not throw it away. Prepare yourself for some hard work and late nights ahead of you. Continue to push yourself to the max. Study, read, reread, and do it all again because you can never be too prepared.",

Do not get tempted into straying away from study time to slack off. On top of all of your studies, do not forget to excersize. Stay healthy and off the snack food.

Your education comes first. I know that right now, you have a lot of pressure to continue your education and earn a bachelors to help,  not only yourself, but your family, as well. Just remember, in the long run, it's all YOU! Focus on school, attend your classes, study! but do it, for you and nobody else. Believe me when I say, it's not going to be easy, but I promise that everything will be fine and rewarding, as long as you do me that one favor. Focus on your studies and do it for YOU! You'll do great, meet new people,  and you'll have fun. I promise. Just manage your time and set your priorities. I wish you luck. You can do it!",

They do not teach you that in school, but it is some of the most helpful things, they are the things that you need to know how to do well to succeed on your own.  These things should be taught in the class room, but since they are not, go out and learn on your own!!",

Do the research and find out how that school rates in placing graduates with your intended degree plan.  Although it sounds exciting to go off to college with your friends, this choice will affect your ability to gain acceptance to graduate school or job placement opportunities upon graduation.  Make sure that the school you choose fits your learning style and your goals.  There is nothing worse than choosing a school for all of the wrong reasons and then having to transfer.  Many times the classes taken at other schools will not transfer to your new school.  Basically, what it all comes down to is taking the time to investigate the school that interests you and making sure that the school fits the person.",

I didn't give my friends the attention I sould have. I would tell myself to enter in more extracurricular activities and have more of a life outside of just my family. I also would have told myself to have more faith in what I can do. I had little confidence in both my artistic ability and my qualities as a leader. Now in college, I've better nurtured both and given myself more confidence. I wish I could be who I am today in high school.",
                "Wesley": "There are three pieces of advice I would give my soon to enter college self, if I could go back in time and deliver such advice. I would recommend the following: starting or joining conversations and activities often, getting out of the dorm room or computer lab often and approaching these situations with confidence.\nOn campus, whether in the classroom, the dorm room or elsewhere, there will be great numbers of new and interesting people to meet. Engage with them, and make friends. Don\u2019t expect them to initiate every time. Start conversations yourself and be part of the conversation, not just an observer.\nGet outside often. Go to ball games, movies, campus events, etc. Invite friends to do things. Join with others who are doing things. Video games are not the only things you can enjoy in your free time. The relationships and experiences one can build in a little time with others could last a lifetime.\nMost importantly, approach life with confidence. Ask questions. Share thoughts. Make an honest impression in other\u2019s lives. If you simply go for what you want, you\u2019ll be surprised at how often you end up getting it.",
                "Kaila": "If I were to go back in time as a high school senior know what I know now about college life and making the transition I would give myself a lot of advice. First would be to study a whole lot more than what I did in high school. Second, is that although college is about having fun and making new memories, set your priorities straight. Third, is to know to never lose your faith. Count on God to get you through everything because He wouldn't bring you to it if He couldn't get you through it.",
                "Ashlann": "Advice that I would give myself as a high school senior, is that everything seems a lot scarier when you first start out. The campuses seem huge and the people seem so mature. However, you are more capable of adjusting and becoming independent then you give yourself credit for. Classes are not as difficult as they seem, and professors are more than willing to help you succeed. Time management is important, and make sure you get to sleep! Most of all, you will love college and the community that surrounds you. You will grow and mature so much during the year, without even realizing it. Enjoy what you have and where you are every moment.",
                "Rachel": "I would advise myself to try harder in my classes in high school as well as take some classes at a community college so that I can come in with some extra credit hours. I would also advise myself to be prepared to study a lot more than I did in high school and to come into college not being shy. To put myself out there and not be afraid because it is another chance to start over at a new school and make new friends.",
                "David": "Honestly? I wouldn't tell myself anything. I am a firm believer in the \"independant lifestyle\" as one might say. With adversity comes change, or so the old saying goes. After all, who can learn properly if they aren't forced to go through new, and challenging things? If I go back in time to talk to myself as a senior, 1) I'm creating a time paradox that is always recommended against creating, but 2nd and most important, I'm robbing my old self of the things I had to go through to become mature enough for college in the first place.\nSo in short, I'd allow myself to experience the cause and effect of my choices in high school, in order to grow from those experiences. And plus, I'd hate to accidentally erase myself from history with all of that time travelling.",
                "Stephani": "Stephani,\nYou know how everyone said senior year is the best year of your life? Don't believe them; it only goes uphill from there!  This year, you're going to experience lots of changes.  Your boyfriend will leave for the Air Force; don't freak out.  You end up marrying him, and the letters you exchanged while long-distance will comfort you forever.  In January, you will get hit by a drunk driver.  Remember to keep pushing through and stay optimistic, you'll be able to walk and go back to school in no time.  LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER!  She'll become your source of comfort and best friend.  She knows what she's talking about; in those moments when you think you'll never raise your children like she has, forget it.  You'll be lucky if you're half the mother she is.  Work hard in school, spend as much time with your friends as possible, and never take life for granted. \nKeep it up in college and you'll make the dean's list! You go, girl!\n\np.s. That boy that broke your heart didn't deserve it.  Stop wondering.\n\nMuch love, \nYour future self.",

If I could go back in time and tell myself what I know now about college I would not have made the mistakes I have made along the way. The transition from high school to college is pretty complicated, but it can be accomplished. First, if you want to be successful do not do what everyone else is doing just to make you \"cooler\".  Just because everyone is doing something does not mean you have to. Second, cherish all of the little moments. Friends will come and go but that is why it is your responsibiltiy to keep in touch and keep them and the memories close. Last, do not be overwhelmed by the big classrooms. Just like in high school, people are here to help you so take advantage of that. I moved 900 miles away from everything I knew, I made lasting friendships, and now i know that there is a man for me. I just had to learn and live through everything in between.",

I'm know at the age where I'm supposed to be getting married and having children, or deep into my career perhaps, but no, instead I'm stuggling through my first degree like a 20 year old.

As a senior in high school, I was chosen by my counselor to be apart of a program called AVP (Area Vocational Program) where I took up what I thought was my destined major in criminal justice at the community college while I was in High School. This transition was probably one of the most increadable things that has happened to me.\nRemenissing back to high school if I would have never taken that offer to start college early, I dont think I would be in such great of shape acidemically. Coming out of high school I graduated with a 3.2 GPA, not bad but I could have done better. Because I was doing something that i loved to do in college though, to this day I stand one class short of my associates with a 3.9. As corney as it sounds I am so proud of myself because I know that like many kids its easy to fall into the wrong boat, but I CHOSE not too.\nSo to answer your question, what  advise would I give myself.....Absolutly None! :)",

It might seem impossible to leave everything you know, and I know it's hard to imagine it now, but you will love the new life you will find in the future. Just follow your dreams, and don't doubt yourself, because everything will be okay.",
                "Brittney": "My advice to myself as a high school senior would be to take as many chances as possible. Keep an open mind and do not be afraid to put yourself out there. You have the ability to achieve many amazing successes and experiences. Invest your time in relationships, your knowledge, and passions. Be confident in yourself. You are the only thing holding yourself back. Meet people from different backgrounds, and place yourself in uncomfortable positions. Through those experiences you will grow the most. Love genuinely, believe faithfully, and live intentionally."

With classes of less than 20, it is easier to be to connect with the teacher and with other students in the classroom.

The professors are always available to talk to academically and personally. Being able to connect with your professors creates an environment that is easy for students to discuss new ideas and research. At ACU, we are blessed to receive a liberal arts education when earning our degree. With this education we can understand the world around us and apply our degree in the real world.",
                "Jazz": "Abilene Christian University makes me brag about several things because there are many aspects that I enjoy about my school. For instance, I love how my school is laid out because it is a medium sized campus. One of the reasons why I enjoy this is because it's small enough that I do not have to run to my next class. Also, by having a smaller campus, I recognize people that I know every day and get to interact with them more than if I were on a bigger campus. I love my school!",

The daily worship was a central experience in my time at ACU.",

The education is great, but the tuition is so high that some people have to leave because they are unable to kep paying. We are currently building a new football stadium and a new science and engineering building because of a donation for some very generous individuals, but that money, some of it at least, could have gone towards alleviating some of the burden of tuition.",

This is what most people wanted to escape from when they went to college, and now it is like we are in high school all over again. Also, there aren't a lot of activities outside of the university for students that don't require spending money, and as broke college kids we need lots of free, fun, and safe things to do.",
                "Hayley": "The most frustrating thing about Abilene Christian Universtiy is the cost. Most students are not able to afford the courses offered here so they drop out or transfer.

Stress is put on students and even the family when money gets tight but school is still needing to get paid for.",

The bean is only open for about 2 hours for each mean than they close. As a result, if a class conflicts with the exact meal times of The Bean you won't get to eat in the cafeteria. The food is amazing though at The Bean.",
                "Adriane ": "Abilene Christian University is expensive and offers fewer scholarships and grants than a state university. I found it frustrating trying to find ways to pay for school.

Meal plans are too structured and confusing, as well as just too expensive, as is board, tuition, and fees. There seem to be a lot of extra hidden charges on my bill when I receive it each semester, and no way to remove them, even if you don't take advantage of a service that you're charged for.",

This is precisely the reason I chose to attend and having attended for a year and a half I would say I would agree. ABAC is a good school, but I need to add something. ABAC is a good school if you are looking for only academics. This is a college for people who want the quick class and nothing else. This is a school for the people going back to college while working or the single mom needing to get a degree while taking care of her child. This is definitely not the school for the typical eighteen year old who wants to experience all types of extracurricular and the normal college life of class then activities or clubs. "

You are going to college for an education not a social experience. Why pay all that money if you are just going to  focus on socializing. I learned the hard way that college professors do not care what is going on in your life. You are in their class, so pay attention and do your work. Being promt and organized is key. The days of shuffling through handfuls of papers, and having books scttered about are over. Get it togethor find your binders, the sticky notes, and highlighters. Get serious quick, and the rest of the semester will flow nicely. Please know that I am not a total bore now that I am serious. I just have my priorities in the right order. You will make friends and hang out, but school comes first. You will be grateful in the end because you will not be stressing over grades at end of term or worrying about keeping grants. Which makes life a lot easier. I wish you the best of luck!",

Why? Because I am a very shy person and I tend to keep away from anything that will get me noticed. I have now discovered in college, that being noticed is not so bad, I actually enjoy it. If I could go back in time, I would definitely tell myself to get more involved with my high school.",

You\u2019ll feel better about yourself and the chances of you doing better in college are much greater if you work hard at it.  The other thing I would tell myself is not to wait so long before going to college.  I wish I would have gone to college as a young adult instead of waiting.  You have so much more going for you at a younger age.  For instance, you have your youth.  You will be able to do more and you will not need as much help.  You will be able to start your career sooner.  If I had started college as a young adult, I would have been in the Nursing profession almost twenty years already.  Instead, I am just starting out.  It will be much harder now because hospitals and doctors will expect so much more from me simply because of my age.  But getting good grades is the number one thing I would tell myself to do.",

While I wait I could have found myself a full time job so I can help my grandmother with bill payments from her clinic and for her medicine that she can\u2019t buy. School to me right now is to expensive. I had wish to have waited a little bit more. When I know I\u2019m fully ready for my future career, I would go and enroll for school and study what I\u2019m studying now, which is medical assisting. I had made a decision right after high school, to go straight to college when I graduate, which was at the age 17. I didn\u2019t think It would be this challenging, but with hope I know I can do this and when I\u2019m finish with school, I will start working and help my grandmother with all her needs because after all she had done for me when I was a child, to pay her back with thankfulness I will take fully responsibility of her and all her needs.",
                "Guillermo": "If I could go back in time and talk myself as a high school senior, I would tell myself that college is very different from high school. Teachers won't baby you and give you extra time for an assignment. You would really have to work hard to get good grades and don't slack off. Also, even though you wonder why you are spending all this kind of money, it will pay off in the long run.",
                "Taylor": "Looking back at myself in high school there are a few things I would have told myself if I would have been able to. I would have said to get started on filling out as many scholarships as possible because once it comes time you will get so busy with everything else your not going to have as much time to complete them as you do then. Also I would have mentioned that I need to start looking for a job near the location of my college because by the time you move in and go out to search for a job there won't be any because many of the college students have already taken them up and you will be left unemployed. The last thing I would have mentioned to my highschool self is to make sure you find the right people to hang out with because some people will lead you down the wrong path and get you in trouble. Learning all this the hard way has given me a good look at what I need to continue to do if I want to further my education.",

I would also tell myself to choice a course that I am very passionate about. I've always loved math and now I am in a field that revolves around math. When I first started college, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer because everyone knows they make a lot of money. I quickly found out that was not the course for me. Because I wasn't surre what I wanted to do when I began, I wasted a year of school on courses I didn't need. The final advice I would give to myself would be to go to a school where I would have to live on campus. Young ones have to grow up sometime. The sooner, the better.",

I see the classes as an experience to expand my knowledge in many various fields which allows me to become smarter and more determined to finish college.",

There are smaller classes and more one on one time with the profesor. I've gotten a lot of great study habits from our free tutoring center here. Before I had no idea how to go about even preparing for a test. Being here is also a major change from my enviroment, and I've always looked at myself as adjusting to any situation. Going from a busy urban area to  an extremely calm rural area was a huge obstacle I was glad to be able to overcome.",

Now that I am in my second semester, and even though I can only afford to attend a community college for now, I have realized that my initial views were not so obscure from reality. While college does present you with tasks that you may not enjoy, many of them are just build-offs from high school, suh as writing long research papers and taking lab tests. And yet college allows you to define yourself more than anwhere else- you start off fresh, a new set of people, a blank transcript, a blank canvas waiting for you to make the moes you want, whether it is to go from that outcast in high school to the party rockstar in college, or to allow yourself to stand up from your beliefs, your goals, and ultimately your future.",

There are many people who have completely different than those who I went to high school with. Learn to make friends out of your comfort zone. The people I grew up with are all at different schools so I would tell myself to learn how to not be so shy and make more friends especially if they are planning to go to the same college.",

I am forced to comtemplate every single decision put in front of me and weigh its pros and cons so that I can be sure that I make the right one and so that it will help me in the future. From things like picking out my classes, the work load I want to take on, and the even what field of study I want to go into requires much thinking and planning because these choices mold my future in ways that I never would have guessed. I wish that I had the chance to tell myselft this as a senior in high school so that i could start planning ahead and determining things such as these earlier. That way I would have known my very first sememster and would had taken only the necesarry classes first.",

Because when I decide to just get by in class it hurts because you have to take a compass test. The test decides where I start. If I do well I can graduate on time but if I don?t I will graduate a semester or two behind. Next I would tell myself that studying is more important than ever, and that the parties and social life will be there when I finish. Also that now you have to pay to get this education so don?t let your money go to waste. The most important this is getting your degree. This is what I would tell myself.",

You must be dedicated and willing to take all the time you need for your classes. You must be willing to sacrifice some of your \"me\" time and study.  Knowing the information I know now, I would say I did a superb job in both high school and college. Although I am a freshman, I am dedicated to school.  The transition from high school to college is extremely different. In high school, there are people who are very immature. In college, you are in a very mature setting.

If larger universities are basically their own cities, then ABAC is the small town equivalent. We have the amenities of any other college (with a full health center on the way) we just don't have three of them. On top of that the small class size is wonderful for anybody that needs a more direct form of instruction and helps to make building relationships with professors that much easier.",

The university organizes many events, but not always related to your major. However, the liberal arts classes and foundations classes that you need to take are too many. The major classes are very few compared to the overall academic path. The buildings are pretty old on campus. The food is only from the vending machines or some cafes in some buildings. At the moment my experience, plus the price of classes, was not very satisfying. "

Being an online student for fashion AA Product Development is the best and worst choice I ever made. The best reasons to enroll online: 1. you can work, tend to other stuff in your life if you're busy. and that's it for the positive. The worst reasons to enroll online is for each class is 3,000 not to mention every instructor you get has different rules on assignments and late work, no matter what if you have a learning disabilities or mental health issue, they will fail you. Also, it's not exactly work when you want every instructor has zoom meetings 1 a week so if you can't make it its 10% off your grade. That is the only time you get to see your instructor, also you don't really get to meet the students or communicate with them unless you personally do so. I have to continue my choice I made coming here till the end. If you can enroll to a community college for fashion (DO IT!) Also attend fashion school in person don't make a mistake to do it online."

                "Comment": "The Academy of Art University helps provide an environment where we can study and learn even offsite with their online semesters. Not only that, it helps to remove and accelerate the knowledge of different subjects through practice. It allows students to seek out their interests going through the trial and error that it takes and learn from those who have come before to teach them those experiences. They pass down their knowledge that can go beyond just learning to help you grow by developing patience, trouble solving skills, and even find ways to help you learn better or teach others who may have similar ideas or interests. I enjoy education because it has helped me understand what I want to do in life, where my interests are, and helped me save time and the headache of trying multiple trials. What education can provide is more than just that; however, it also facilitates development progression.\nFurthermore, I have learned a great deal. I have experienced so much during my time attending that I would recommend this College to anyone considering furthering their education. I feel that AUU stands by its goal of teaching real jobs skills and helping develop them for future careers."

For those wanting to go there, my advice through experience is make sure you apply for financial aid and cal-grant. Also, find a job if possible before going there because, my mother had to apply for parent plus loan because financial did not cover everything; school housing, tuition, fees, class material, housing food. Also, using left over money from financial aid for other stuff/emergency. I was ineligible for work study grant because parent plus loan covered it. \n\nIf you want to go there on campus I advise finding cheap housing with rooming a peer or school mate going there, (be safe with unknown people) or if you know someone who lives in San Francisco. Some school housing REQUIRES food meal plan. I HATE this because I spend $2400 for 2 semesters or $4800 for 1 year (A semester equals about 4-5 months). I could have saved a lot of money if not for a requirement. There is no refunds or partial refunds if you barely eat the required housing meal plans that some housing requires students to have.\n\nAnother advice is to stay at home and take online course and work somewhere close to save a lot of time and money for a year to get your plan together and see when go onsite campus if on campus or home would be a preferred choice.\n\nFor me I took online classes at home for summer semester, then went to school for fall and spring semesters onsite campus. I decided to go back home and take online courses to save time and money. "

I attend online and have had a few bad teachers but for the most part the teachers are amazing and very involved. The only downside is like I said before super expensive but I am hoping it all pays off.  There are a few lenders for private loans that the school takes and I wish they actually expanded the list because the lenders are the toughest ones to get loans from. Do good research before attending any school. "

Depending on how serious you are about pursuing a career in the arts, this school can prepare you to be the best. You either come out from this school a successful artist or an art school dropout. They give you all the tools you need, you just have to be willing to use them."

But I feel like the school is lacking in some areas such as the food, access to a gym, and few options to housing. Feel likes is doesn't total with how much I've spent going here. Seems like the spending in the school are spent through other things which can reflect on the student poorly. "

However, keep in mind that I am writing this review as an online student, my experiences versus and onsite student may be different. Online however, it is an excellent school. The program is easy to use, and even if you have troubles it is easy to find help with whatever problem your facing. The students and professors are accepting and 100% willing to help out. I haven't had a negative experience personally. Any troubles I have had have been with me personally trying to figure out the technology side (I am not as tech savvy as I would like to be). Even though I may have had some minor difficulties, I was always able to figure it out at the end, there is always a solution. If there was one complaint, it is that the school is not financially accessible to everyone. I am online rather than onsite because of financial reason, however know that there are answers and it is possible to attend this college if your heart is set on it!"

The online classes allow me to work from home, and this gives me more time to get other things done quicker. This university doesn't load my class schedule with classes that I do not need. The only classes required are those in my field of study, and this allows me to stay focus and on task.",

All the software and programs are all up to date. Labs and equipments are not notch and readily available for student uses. Another great thing is our spring show; where big name studios, corporations, and recruiters from all over come and hire students right on the spot. Also, the envionment the school provides is just perfect for artist and student alike.",

It is an \"art\" school but very much buiness oriented for the feilds those have chosen. Each teacher is currently working in the feild they teach as a professional. Most of the students at this school are international students.",

There are workshops for most majors on campus,. There is100% guaranteed housing, but very expensive. It is also the cheapest art school in terms of  tuition cost, but they don't have work study. It is in San Francisco, living cost is really high, but its is nice. But full time study online is difficult because you are cut off from having a real social experience.",

                "Wai ": "Academy of Art is a art school with a good fashion and textile program.  They have instructors who are experience in the field of fashion and some of them worked for famous designers and own their own company and brand. Even though some of these design teachers are good designers some aren't cut out to be teachers.  A lot of students cry just because the teachers were too blunt and rude.",
                "Heather ": "This is the only art school that offers a degree in case you need it to pursue other types of work; it's basically a back up and a way to say you graduated a post secondary school. The best thing and I think the only thing are the teachers. They are real working professionals and really know their art. The administration is pretty laxed and it's fairly easy to get classes waived and other things you might need.",

                "Juliana ": "Academy of Art University offer students the opportunity to learn from teachers who are actively working in their fields of expertise. This Fact makes the Academy of Art  a unique school compared to others.  It is interesting to see how the school staff worries and work towards the professional realization of every single student how atends the Academy. They treat you as the person you are and not just another number, and this is exactly what makes this school one of the best and more wanted designs schools in the United States."

Don't focus on finding part time jobs that aren't going to help further your skills and experience for what you are studying. Consider unpaid internships before paid ones; those are ones you will be learning the most from. \n\nDO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE END GOAL AMANY. Spend weeknights in the studio working on your resume, spend weekends visiting galleries and looking for inspiration to become a better creative professional than you were the day before. Oh yeah, MASTER THE CREATIVE SUITE! Take some sva classes if you need to! \n\n2. DON'T WORRY ABOUT FINDING LOVE AND DEVOTING MORE TIME TO A RELATIONSHIP THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT WORK OUT THAN TO THE CAREER PATH YOU ARE PURSUING AMANY!!!.

I noticed that students who felt the biggest sense of community amongst peers are those who lived in the dorms. Those of us who live locally don't build relationship in the same manner primarily because we don't have to. I would also tell my high school self to be more driven, I didn't become a good student until college. During my senior year I had the worst senior-itis and it really affected my GPA, which in turn affected which grants and scholarships I could apply for, and left me to struggle for tuition money now. If my high school self had buckled down and pulled the grades that I knew were possible things would be different. The most important advice I could give myself then that still applies now is to follow your gut and do what you feel will make you happy.

College is not as relaxed as high school but it is a necessary step before obtaining your ideal career. Try to not be overwhelmed with all the paperwork, just take it one page at a time. You will regret it if you don't take your education a step further. Though there are jobs out there that don't require a higher education, it will get you further than you could ever imagine in your dream career.

It was not necessarily a matter of laziness, but more of a \"victim of naivety\" one.  I was oblivious to the realities of the world beyond grade school - a place I had felt I blazed right through - so I believed that things would just happen without much of an effort on my part...a hard lesson I would soon learn.   Classes were harder and work loads were heavier.  Stress became a real factor, and so did disappointment and regret.  Confidence is the key to success, yes, but you have to combine it with a headstrong work ethic or you will not achieve what you want to in life.  Everyone says that high school is where you find out who you are, but to my graduate-to-be self I say this: your entire perspective on your life and career are about to change and for the better.  Stay confident, but go forward with the drive to take charge of your dreams.  Dream hard, live hard, but most importantly, work hard.",

For your scripting final try a Rock'Em Sockem Robot game or something simplier your actual final was a total mess because you/me tried to do something too big for a starter class and make sure you put time and effort into it. Start attending the Analysis of Form workshops as early as possible you get to meet Ms. Yuka and Satomi there and get to know them early.

The amount of stress that has put me through in the last half a year has been almost unbearable, but even so, I don't want to warn my younger self about that. I feel like if I warned her about the money strain,  my father and her can plan more accordingly and she won't ever have to feel the pain I've felt from my father's harsh words and disappointment.  At that time, my dad had complete faith in me and full support in my dreams.

I overthought every decision, resulting in me giving up before I actually strived toward a goal. My senior year was probably the worst acedemically, mainly because I wanted it to be as easy as possible (who knew I'd have to exert myself in non-core classes). Because I was not sure of what I was doing, I was not motivated to work for anything. I remember literally thinking, \"Ugh, it won't matter anyway. Why waste my energy?\" So instead of applying my abilities to grades and obtaining scholarships, I stressed out over trivial drama, my future, and sports. I was scared to commit to anything, especially since I was changing my mind so quickly. But knowing what I do now, I would plead with that complacent, blinded girl to set a goal and strive toward it.

Now I was a single mom with no education, and two kids to raise on my own. And there I was with all those regrets knowing I was a smart kid, I could have done better for myself.  Looking back, I started to have many regrets.  I should have followed my initial dream of joining the US Navy, or going to college to become an RN. I should have taken dual credit classes and earned credit while in high school.  I should have focused less on having a part-time job for spending change, and focused more on taking practice exams for my SAT/ACT.  I feared college thinking it wasn't for me.

I always thought that a degree wasn't necessary to succeed or that I could always return to college if I wanted to pursue a degree. I am now 47-years old and trying to get my degree. Life doesn't always go as planned but there is one constant: a person with a college degree is more attractive to a company than a person without one. Sacrifices may be required and obstacles may have to be overcome, but completing a college degree program gives a person a sense of accomplishment like none other.

When I was taught about scholarship as an upward bound student in high school, it would be a miracle to advice myself to challenge myself more and apply for variety of scholarship other than the ones that I have already applied for. I was also  afraid to work long hours. I thought that I would not be able to handle any of my high school assignments along with sport. However, it was a different story while in community college.

Our dad always told us that life is the adventure that you make it. \nCollege is scary, but you are taking the next step by refusing to let fear drive your heart. It\u2019s terrifying to face a massive giant that you must conquer. Yet fear has never been a part of what our family stands for and to give into fear would be an insult to everything you have worked for. \n\nLastly, find that inner warrior, the one that would fight for every breath and press on without giving up, because this is your life. You are in control no matter what anyone has ever said. The power to succeed is in you. \nYours,\n Sam",

College is expensive and you don't want to be in debt for the rest of your life. Figure out what you want to do and enjoy doing it. Don't settle for your major, you are gonna have to work hard to get to college so make sure you really enjoy studying what you are going to be studying. High school isn't everything. Don't think that your world will end when high school is over. Your life have just started, so try to keep positive and keep moving forward. Get Ready for the exciting and inspiring ride that awaits you. It is going to be awesome. \n                        Sincerely, College Mark",
                "Yesmen": "I don't have much college experience besides the community college I attended out of high school. In the world I grew up in going away to school was never an option. Until now that is. My father started using drugs a few years ago and ever since then my entire world has changed. I'm head of my house hold now. I never would have invisioned my life to turn out this way but it did. If I could go back in time I would tell myself to go against my parents and do what I want with my life. I'd tell myself it's going to hard but very well worth it. I would prepare myself for my fathers addiction and make the decision to put myself first this time. I'd remind myself of my own worth. I'd tell myself that it's a cold world and if you don't do anything for youself then what makes you think anyone is going to do anything for you? If you don't believe you're worth it then trust me, no one else will either. So I'd tell myself to go. Just go.",

I would tell myself to follow my heart.",
                "Leonarda": "Don\u2019t be afraid. That is exactly what I would tell myself high school. Your friends may seem like they have everything figured out taking pictures with their future university sweaters, knowing exactly what it is they want to major in. Have no fear if you graduate high school and continue your education with an undecided major. There is nothing wrong with that. Gather your talents, hobbies, and interests and make a list of them. Use that list to help you discover what it is that you want to learn, master, and do for a living.Secondly, College is hard. There will be times you will think that you are in the wrong major or even want to quit. The key to success is to never give up. Every accomplishment makes everything worthwhile. Never lose sight of your goals by falling into procrastination or temptations to party more than you can afford.Finally, money is not an excuse for you not to graduate from college. Exhaust every grant and scholarship option you have. Be confident and optimistic when applying. You can\u2019t get help if you don\u2019t ask for it in the first place.",

I\u2019m currently a junior at the Academy of Art University and it took some time for me to get there.  Transferring into a new school taught me to trust my instincts and not to settle on a school just because you got in.  Its ok to go to a community college and work part time while you figure out what you want to do.When you find the perfect school that matches you its ok to have a little fun. Keeping your grades up is important but so is trying to have a social life.  Don\u2019t be afraid to meet people and have new experiences. Know that school can be a financial struggle,  applying for scholarships is a great way to offset the cost of what financial aid won't cover.  If you don\u2019t get a scholarship right away don\u2019t get discouraged keep applying, stay persistent and try to keep positive. Going to college maybe be a new beginning but staying and finishing college is what will give you a great future.",

Do not pass go, do not collect $200.\u201d  At 18 we are all convinced that we know exactly what needs to happen.  Or what we think we need.  Those of us who are a little older and wiser have a better grasp on the difference between the ideas of want and need.  I see now that going immediately to school, even a community college, would have put me on a more direct path that would have gotten me closer to my goals faster.  As fun as the idea of backpacking though Europe or moving in with a friend right after high school is, and I had a blast, believe me, the distractions that kept me preoccupied over the last 14 years changed my life in such a way that I am only now, in my 30s, getting back to where I need to be.  The notion that some people have of saying they have \u201cno regrets\u201d is bologna.  That just comes from people who haven\u2019t admitted they were wrong.

You will feel nervous and alone, but just remember everyone on his or her first day of college feels nervous and alone. The best advice that I can give you is to relax, enjoy this time. Let the transitions shape who you are, not how you feel. I would also like to tell you to go to class everyday and do the homework, it is the only way you are going to survive this higher education program.",

Life then was easy breezy, but it doesn't stay that way forever my friend.\nWhen you go onto college, stay focused. Never waste a single minute, and remember to pursue your goals no matter what anyone tells you. I know dad may be hard on you and can put you down sometimes but stay strong! It will all come together. Do that homework girl, it's not that difficult. Never forget that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. Never let anyone make you feel like less than you are. Never give up. And don't forget to follow your dream, no matter what.\nNow go out tonight, have an amazing time. Be yourself. And never, ever let go of that drive you have. It will take you far my friend.\n\nLove,\n\nMe",

It is never to late to attend school, but if you are attending school be ready to work hard. Start on scholarships as soon as possible. Don't let your personal life influence your work, unless it is in a good way. It isn't always about perfection but trying the best that you can. Pick your friends carefully, they will help you fail or fly. It is okay to ask for help, that is why schools have resources. If you get a chance take it and don't be afraid to let it change your life. The harder you work the more it shows and in the end that is what counts. The only person holding you back is yourself. Things you would never expect to happen will happen, good and bad. And every time you think it's getting too hard and you can't go on, look at those who did go on, and if they can do it why can't you?"

Someone who wants to go through school depending on everyone to succeed should not Attend the academy either.

                "Comment": "LET THE BUYER / PROSPECTIVE AIMC STUDENT BEWARE!!!  I am a former TCM student from AIMC. I have performed acupuncture in their student clinic. I attended the program full time from 2005-06 and left due to pregnancy. I was not unhappy with the education I received when I was there, nor was I unhappy with the clinic at that time. (Not sure how it is there now as I have not been back in awhile.)  But if you're like me, you want to believe that the general mentality of a school/ clinic where you go for acupuncture is one of healing rather than of deception and shady practices. I used to believe AIMC was such a place, and as a massage therapist and pre med student, I have sent many massage clients to the AIMC clinic in the past. I have stopped doing so and here is why: (please pardon the long post)\n\n  When I went down to the school for my exit interview in 2006, I was told that I owed nothing more. After that, I was never contacted by anyone from AIMC again, even though I have had the same contact phone since 2001. About six months ago, I applied for a bachelor's program and was soon was informed by my prospective new school that AIMC had placed a hold on my transcripts. Apparently AIMC was now suddenly claiming that I did owe them money after all, about two hundred bucks for a dropped class.\n\n For over six months I have been dealing with this issue with them in an attempt to resolve this supposed debt and get the hold removed from my transcripts so that I can continue my education. I have left numerous voicemails, spoken by phone to a live person who claimed to take a message and sent out a blanket email to faculty and the school president. All went unanswered. Finally, a few months ago, I went down to the school and spoke with an Asian woman on the first floor. I don't remember her name but she claimed to work in financial aid. I explained to her my situation and the fact that I am a single mom on a tight budget who would have difficulty paying two hundred bucks upfront even if I did owe it. I suggested that since it seemed the school had made a clerical error years ago and never contacted me about it in ten years AND since they had already received several thousands of dollars of tuition from me in the past, they might just let this one go. Or at least remove the hold on my transcripts and allow me to make payments on the amount that they claimed I owed. The woman refused to work with me. We argued for several minutes over whether or not I owed this amount and whether or not it was fair to suddenly attempt to collect a ten-year-old alleged debt that I had not been informed of AFTER I had previously been told I owed nothing. Eventually I was near tears and asked the woman what I needed to do in order to get the hold removed from my transcripts.\n\nThe woman said I could pay the balance in three payments and then the school would release my transcripts. She typed up a contract which stated payment amounts and dates spanning three months' time. BUT.. the contract stipulated that if I were to be late any given month on a payment, I would have to pay a late fee of at least $50. (I don't remember the exact amount but it was at least $50 and may have been higher.) Again we argued. I told her I was not comfortable with the terms and that they felt \"loan sharkish\". I felt I was being punished for the school's clerical errors. The woman remained coldly unmoved, though she did say that if I knew I was going to be late with a payment, i could call her before the due date and she would not charge the late fee. I realize it was was totally stupid of me to sign such a contract. I was desperate and very upset, and this woman used that to her advantage. Of course, I was unable to make payments for a few months due to financial hardship and when I attempted to call this woman more than once, I received no call back. That fact and the knowledge of how much AIMC will now probably claim in late fees caused me to become very stressed out. I was taking classes at another school and home schooling my son (and working) and I just couldn't deal with continuing to fight. so for a few months, I stopped trying to contact anyone at AIMC.\n\nLast week, with finals done, I decided I was ready to contact the school again. I left a few voicemails and sent out emails to several faculty members, including the president of the school. No response in over a week from anyone. My next move will be the Better Business Bureau and eventually possibly a lawyer. I am not sure if the general mentality of AIMC school/ clinic was always this shady or if something has changed in recent years. I do know that such a mentality and practices are the opposite of that which a true healing institution should have. This is not at all an environment conducive to healing."

But if I could talk to my senior self, I would tell her that there is nothing more important than education, cliched as that may sound. I would tell her to go to school every day, to attend every class, to do her homework and study hard. Get into college as soon as you can. Because life on the minimum wage payroll, or even slightly above minimum wage, is not fun. It's hard. It's stressful. In this day in age, your options for making money are limited.  Limited even further if you don't have that precious degree. In the town I grew up in, few people make it to college. I'm proud to say I'm finally one who did, but wish it had come sooner.",
                "Merry": "If I could go back in time, I would tell myself not to put off going to college.  You will regret it in the coming years when you are not  able to obtain  employment in your chosen field.  You want to be an example for your children to follow,  and if you do not provide that example, then your children may not choose to further their education and may not be able to obtain employment that will enable them to take care of themselves and their families.   \n\nI would tell myself that education will help you to live the life of satisfaction rather than a life of regrets.  It will open doors that are not open if you do not have the knowledge and skills earned in further education.  Do not give up on yourself, but continue to pursue your goals of obtaining a college degree in your chosen field of study.  You will be a great human service professional.  Pay attention, attend your classes and study hard and you will achieve your goals.  Do not let anything hold you back especially self-doubt.  Tackle your education head-on with full force.  You will be glad you did."

Many parks are located near campus with about a 10 - 30  minute walking distance. The campus provides many activities outside of school like rock climbing, going to the sand dunes, camping, job fairs, games, and more. Student life is great, although there are dorms. The dorms do not have a kitchen, but there are on campus housing that do provide a kitchen, with additional charges to housing. While living in regular on campus housing is sometimes hard, there are many on campus facilities. Adams State provides a gym, with low fee memberships, a loft for gaming, a library with many good resources, a green top with lushes grass, an art, music, theatre, and science building with many great professors, and even two dining areas with which you can choose from. Adams State has many great professionals as well as students that are encouraging and make for a great time here. I would advise anyone who is seeking to engage in their community and to further their education to enrol into Adams State University. "

                "Comment": "This is a good school for students who come from a small high school like me, student who aren't a big fan of the city, and/or students who need less distraction from their surroundings. School food is just like every other school, taste cheap, but can't complain, because they keep us feed. Professors are always around to help, but the student have to come ask for help, and they also remember names, or at least most do. Parties are fun, but never go anything passed it. Sometimes the town can  be very sketchy, and can be really boring, but the town people are super nice, and friendly, and stuff happens into that the student of the college is invited to. When you enter into Alamosa, like me, they\u2019re worries of racial comments, but since I been here, I have yet to hear anything close to racial, and the people in this town know how to have fun too. It a great place to go to school, it is a little pricey, but what you learn from this school, and the amount of fun that we here, makes up for it. I highly recommend Adams State University for students looking for a good college to go to. If you know what you want a degree in, then they have advisor ready for you as you get here, and if you don\u2019t, then you still get an advisor to help you with anything, which is very helpful. Just have to ask."

If I had the opportunity to go back and speak with myself as a senior in High School, I would offer one modest piece of advise for his forthcoming college experience. I would humbly ask my past self to not only listen in class, but to genuinely comprehend the material teachers offer him. I would request that my earlier existence not just pay attention, but engage in the class and retain the valuable knowledge presented.

You are an adult now, you are going to have to step up and be prepared to take on life as your own person.

I would then proceed to tell myself that preperation requires responsibility. When you leave home and go to college, mom isn't there to look over your grades and teachers aren't there to tell you what to do. You as an idividual have to be responsible in managing your time and preparing yourself to succeed. There is no other truth than this world is big and your all by yourself in it when you leave home.

On top of great professors who put so much of their time and energy into my success, I had opportunities that many college students don't get. I was able to do an internship in Kenya, Africa where I worked at an orphanage teaching English. I also had experiences such as being the Head Editor of the school newspaper and being part of the Varsity soccer team. All of these experiences have distinguished me as a person and built my character. Without my college experience, I would not be as cultured or as knowledgeable on a variety of issues. More importantly, college led me to the decision to pursue graduate school and obtain a Master's in Speech-Languague Pathology. Without my experiences at Adams State I would never have reached this point and I would not be beginning my journey to a career where I can make a real difference in the lives of children.

My professors have tought me not to doubt my abilities cause if I'm always doubtful about my actions/decisions then I won't get anywhere in life. In order to be successful I have to step out of my comfort zone and do what needs to be done. I've become a lot stronger within this first year and I intend to mature more as the years come and go.",
                "Robert ": "As a college student I would go back to when I was a senior and say follow the greeks advice, \"Everything in moderation.\" It helps to have good grades, and be involved in college, but it's more important to make some time for yourself. I would tell myself not to be a hermit. It's vital that I work harder on grades than on extracirricular activities. I would tell myself not to go to a college just for its great athletic association. I would tell myself that I should put up with roommates only to a point. It's not healthy to just receive insults every night from someone. I would make a suggestion that I get to know some of my professors better. I would communicate to myself that I need to be more social even at the expense of getting embarassed. I would tell myself to remember that people are usually good people, and when they say something that seems very mean they're probably just joking. The final thing I would tell myself is stay determined. Remember people depend on you and some are looking for guidance such as a younger sibling.",
                "Kyla ": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself in high school I would allow myself to understand that college is not going to be the easiest thing I will have to go through. In order to allow myself to become what I am suppose to become I must push through and enjoy what I have instore for my future.  I would have also told myself that inorder to get through college I will need to earn some money to help pay for everything.",

                "Travis ": "Knowing what I do now there are plenty of things that I would tell myself as a high school senior.  One of the number one things would be to be very efficient at time management. College is very unlike highschool in the aspect that everyone has their own schedule and your parents wont be there to tell you to get up and go to school.  While being very academically focused, you also don't want to bury yourself in books all the time.  As part of time management it is good to get your school work done while also having a decent social life.  You only go to college once which means you dont want to mess up your GPA for grad school, but there are plenty of people to socialize with and become friends with for life.  The party scene is okay sometimes but one must know when to party and when to crack down on his or her studies.  Overall I think the best advice I would give myself is to be academically focused, choose the collge you want to go to (not your parents) and have a balance in your life.",

                "Kathleen ": "If I could go back in time and tell the senior high student I was back then things they need to know going into college I would tell her two things. First off I would tell her that money does not grow on trees. This applies to paying for college and for a pesronal bank account. Budgeting is important and a skill she would need to practice from the very begining. I would tell her not to get the starbucks credit card since having credit is not a good thing until you learn to buget. Also I would tell her to keep her GPA up and not to overload her self since having a good GPA helps get scholarships that keep student loans from racking up. The second thing I would tell her is to be her self, don't do things just to be liked. People will like you for who you are and there is not need to be fake. These are things I learned the hard way and am lucky to have learned them quickly and early on in my college experiance. However life would have been a whole lot easier had I learned them earlier on.",
                "Erica ": "After my college experience thus far, I definitely wish I could go back and talk to myself, my senior year. The advice I would give myself is based on everything that I have learned about what it takes to be a successful student. The first and foremost thing I would tell myself, is that it takes a lot more to pass your exams, than just reading your notes the night before. During my freshman year as a college student, I never was thoroughly prepared to take exams. I would study the night before, from my notebook. This no doubt, was a poor study habit, which resulted in bad scores, which lead to bad grades. I would tell myself that you have to actually read your textbooks, and apply it to the material you are studying.  I would also say that you need to study in an area that you can stay focused, not somehwere that you can get distracted easily. If I was able to tell myself the good study habits, I would of been a lot more successful in my academic success. However,  you live and learn, and now I'm on the right track.",
                "Brandon ": "if i could go back i would have made myself keep my math class so when i got to college algebra my brain would still be fresh in math.

Every experience of your life has prepared you for this great opportunity to service yourself by the expansion of knowledge and health in so that you may be able to be of service to others to benefit humanity on earth as a whole.  college is as anything is that of what you make it to be.  you are the one who determines your future and the qualities there of.  it is you who must make the choice of effort to achieve something of significance, something of greater purpose than your own, something that spreads the choice of love and equality not fear and hierarchy.  make sure to gain a greater perspective on life by trying new things while remembering the  old.  value your beliefs and be acceptant of others, but keep your boundaries and guard up to not lose track of your goals to become a more balanced and vibrant individual in this ever changing world.  Remember don't take anything for granted and everything happens for a reason but nothing isn't anything without your commitment to living and loving life intelligently and spiritually, fully unconditionally. thank you",
                "Chad ": "Go to college as soon as you can. The longer you wait to get a great education and career, the longer and harder your education will be. The more time inbetween high school and college, the more likely you are to drop out or not attend. After high school, if you are not in college you probably won't be working at the job of your dreams. Going to college increases your odds of financial success and personal happiness greatly. College can be the most rewarding thing you ever do in your life, make sure you don't wait to go.",
                "Paul ": "When looking at a major or an emphasis in school leave all your options open, but don't overload yourself. Take your time with everything in school. Don't rush through it, it may be some of the best years of your life. Also realize why you are attending college; to learn. Do the work and make an effort to get a lot out of every class, you are paying for it. Have fun.",
                "Bryce ": "I would tell myself to work harder in high school. If I had taken more AP credits and worked a little harder, it would have simplified alot of the general education credits and helped out so much more. I would also warn about my first roommate, who was a drug dealer and very difficult to live with. Overall, I would try to set myself on the premed path much earlier instead of deciding right before college. I think this would have been beneficial and made me a much better student currently. I would also try to get myself to worry less and be more independent then, because it would be good to be in better practice for that. I would also tell myself that it's ok to be who I am and that I shouldn't worry about what people think about me. I feel these would all address issues I've experien ce since coming to college.",

Because of Covid-19, my program has been remote since it started (Fall 2020) besides about 5 in-person meetings for demonstrations. Even with all of the difficulties that come along with online learning, I have enjoyed my experience, my professors, and the learning environment that has been established during out Zoom class meetings. The professors in my program are knowledgeable, approachable, and willing to help their students. Plus, having a small class size (10-20 students depending on the class) makes it even better and easier for me to have a personalized relationship with the other students and professors in the program. The campus itself is beautiful and just the right size, parking has never been an issue for me when I did have to attend in-person. Their safety precautions due to the pandemic have also been thorough, including daily health checks on the mobile app before arriving on campus. Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Adelphi and recommend it to other students who are looking for a comprehensive yet individualized education. I have felt safe, encouraged, challenged, and enlightened during my time at Adelphi University."

There is also a lot of clubs that you can join so that no one feels alone. The transition from high school to college was a little hard on me because I didn't know anyone and for me it was different, but Adelphi help to change that. There are a lot of programs during and after.Before starting my semester I was able to attend many different events to help me feel comfortable with the transition from high school to college along with getting to know people and make friends. I was able to attend acceptance day, Orientation. First Year community services and Welcome back weekend which was for all freshman. Overall Adelphi is a great college to attend you won't feel alone or out of place. My college is very diverse and we accept everyone culture and race, we even celebrate them in school.The professors are also great because if I need help with my essay I can go to my mentor, professor and the writing center for help. I can email my professors for help from home and they will respond when they can. The professor is always there to help make sure we understand what we are learning and the assignments that are assigned to us. "

I love this school because it is a completely dry campus which enables me to focus on my school work and get the grades that I want. This campus has opportunities for everyone. There are many sports teams playing everyday which people can go and watch and cheer on the school spirit. There are also clubs for each major as well as peoples interest. Adelphi University will always be my place of study. "

Diverse student body, professors are attentive so as long as you are on their good side, and offers decent job and internship opportunities for various majors."

I live in a urban area that\u2019s heavily populated with streets, train stations and bus stops that show it. Adelphi University is clean, well designed and big enough to feel like you can explore and small enough to not have to run to classes. The teachers and advisors are wonderful. They take the time and effort to really help and listen. The classrooms are well managed and organized. There are many activities and events constantly going on and I truly do miss it all. I had an incredible  experience at Adelphi. It became my second home, with people who became my second family. "

Since Adelphi's campus is so diverse you can wear anything you want and fit in somewhere. Financially Adelphi is also diverse. Some students drive their brand new BMW's proudly while others struggle to buy a slice a pizza. In know way will you be made to feel inferior. Politically Adelphi is vocal. Most of the left wing students are more active, but the campus is still politically diverse. \r\nWhen walking into the university center you will see several table of students. On one side you will see all the students in a fraternity or sorority, and a few of there friends not in the organization. That group is very diverse. Next you will see a table of Asian students sitting together speaking there country's language. There may be one table of all African American students.

By the school showing a different side than the common i felt that people felt more open to expressing their support. I have yet to see a person being bullied or discrimnated against, everyone is so different that you learn to respect eachothers cultures and history. Everyone is friendly and it is not difficult to make friends because there are always programs and events going on where many different people attend, so you will have many multicultural and multiracial friends.

There is a general understanding that not everyone is the same and that people come from different backgrounds and socio-economic statuses and I\u2019ve never seen anyone being targeted based on any of the aspects mentioned above. People interact with each other all the time maybe because they are in the same club or part of the same fraternity or maybe it\u2019s simply because they share the same job. People come to class wearing all different types of clothing and no one says anything about it. We have a lot of overachievers that dream big and are not afraid to go after their dreams.

It is also easy to get a hold of your professors, any that that aren't easy to get a hold of are just bad professor.  \r\nClass participation is a must for a good grade. Just force yourself to say at least once thing in every class and you will be fine.  \r\nOnly the students that care, to much, turn the classes into a competition. Some people have nothing better to do. \r\nThe General Education requirements are a bit annoying to fill but all schools usually make you take other classes than your major. My favorite elective class has to be Media and Children. The course topic is light and interesting. The work is manageable and doesn't overload you.    \r\nMy major, which is social work, is a perfect balance of theory and practice. The program is currently going through some changes but I'm excited for them. I'm confident that what I'm learning in the classroom I will be able to apply in the field. \r\n\r\n",

You feel like you are receiving that one on one learning experience. Its not a lecture hall with 200 kids and the professor does not care if you don't show up for class, they care that you attend their lectures and get something out of it.",
                "Samantha": "In regards to academics here at Adelphi I love that the classes are small. I think that the large lecture halls that most schools have are not appealing at all. The most I have ever had in a class was about 35 or 40. And that is even pushing it, I really like that the class sizes are small because you feel like you matter in class and can ask questions and feel that the professor actually gets to know you and cares if you succeed. I also feel that we have a really good variety of classes to pick from whether its an art class, a fitness class, a class on horror in film and literature, or a performance class, or even the science courses here, there is a lot of variety in what you can take and how you want to make your schedule. The professors are really good about having office hours that you can go to and talk to them about different things if necessary. My major is business management and I feel that the Business school is really there to always help me if I have questions or any concerns at all. I personally loved my horror in film and lit class because we got into the psychology of what makes horror real and interesting and how the films and readings are really created and why the author and director does what they do. ",
                "Stephanie": "The academic classes in our school are good,  but they can be better. It depends on the classes you take and the professor you have. I know all my professors names and their contact information, all of them are willing to help me if i seek help or just wish to discuss something. In these classes you will learn and become educated while being academically challanged. It is important to ensure that you will get a job once you graduate but in these classes you are able to apply what you learn in an effort to better understand why you are learning the material that you are. My favorite class is Human Anatomy because you learn so much information about how your body works and it is amazing to learn about health and spread my knowledge to others that i know. It is important information that one can apply to everyday life.",

Circle K is one of the largest clubs on campus. There you will be guaranteed to meet a ton of people. \r\nCertain Building are more friendly than others. Regrading the dorms,  Chapman hall have a more open door feel. While the upper class-men buildings such as new hall are like hotels where you don't talk to anyone but your roommate and friends. I recommend living in Chapman as a freshmen and once you find your group moving into the nicer, but less friendly building. I meet my closest friends in Chapman Hall. \r\nThe most popular play to be on the nights out are the local bars. You will see everyone there. If not the bars the at A&S or cherry valley, the local 24 hour study break or drunken food places. If your not someone who drinks, don't worry, these bars are fun for you too. It is just an easy place to see everyone. Otherwise you and your friends can hangout in the dorms, go out to dinner, see a movie, or maybe go to the mall. Remember New York City is just a 40 minute train ride away. You'll find something to do.\r\n\r\nThere are so many things to look forward to at Adelphi. The spring concert by far is my favorite. My freshmen year we had snoop dog and my sophomore year we had Taking Back Sunday, I can't wait for next year. \r\n\r\nOne of the things I also love about Adelphi activities is the discount Broadway tickets Adelphi sells.

All clubs and organizations are open to everyone to join, and even though LASO is latin based, we are a very multicultural group. Some students choose to leave their dorm room open, such as how i do. Because we all know eachother and everyone is aware that we are all friends and can speak to eachother at any time. Fraternities and Sororities are not very important in my school because there are many things you can get involved in and make friends in, that is not only possible if you join greek life.",

SAB, student activities board is the committee that works on student events on campus. This is also one of the major clubs on campus that many are involved in.

Athletic events are a lot of fun to go to and many take place on campus such as volleyball games, baseball games, and soccer games as well as many others. There are also a variety of guest speakers that come to Adelphi such as book authors, doctors in their specialized fields, etc. I met my closest friends through these clubs as well as my dorm hall. My building is very tight-knit and everyone knows everyone else through Cat Cup events which is the halls competing against each other to win a trophy. There's always something to do on campus. There are events weekly in halls, events in the UC lobby, as well as various other locations on campus. Adelphi University is also 15 minutes away from Roosevelt field mall as well as other stores such as TJ Max, target, Wal-Mart and much more.

Most students own at least one Adelphi Article of clothing and wear it proudly. But without a football team it is very hard to motivate the school to be excited about sporting events. The other sports don't attract the same level of crowd as football games could. \r\nWhen I tell other people I go to Adelphi, those who are from the area look at it as a good thing. Other areas of the country won't know what the hell I'm talking about. You get use to it.\r\nOne of the biggest complaints I, and most of the student body have about the campus is the food. It is unhealthy, repetitive and sometimes gross. A sandwich is a sandwich but sometimes you just want a little more. Personally I recommend getting the smallest meal plan and asking your parents for the rest of the money in cash so you can eat out once a week. It will help break up the week of meals. If I could change anything it would diffidently be the food.\r\n \r\nOne of the things I will never forget about Adelphi is the people. I'm involved in very different parts of Adelphi. Each and every person a meet is diverse and worth knowing. I wouldn't trade it for the world.\r\n",

In the University Center we have our center for student involvement which is there to answer any questions about campus organizations or events. We have more than 30 organizations on campus that help us as students get more involved in anything we are interested in. In our Levermore building which has the admissions and student affairs office, are to guide you with any problem you may be having academically. ",
                "Ana": "Adelphi University is very a diverse campus. Students are offered the opportunity to not only excel academically, but socially as well. Many clubs and organizations help aid the student to perform well with people in general and to communicate. There are many community service events that one can be a part of, as well as educational seminars with guest speakers on various topics. Other services such as the writing, learning and career centers are also available to guide students in the right path towards accomplishing their career goals. All of this is set in a campus that is alcohol and drug free, creating the perfect setting for students to completely engage in their studies. Adelphi is a community where leaders are born in all areas and aspect of the well-rounded student. ",
                "Samantha": "I think that Adelphi is great! Honestly, I love living on campus and I love being involved in all of the organizations that I am a part of and that's what I think really makes the college experience. I think that the best thing at Adelphi is the different things to become a part of and the leadership opportunities that we offer to students. Whether it's on the executive board of a club, or as an Orientation Leader, or honor societies, Greek life, or being a part of clubs or studying aborad, I think that Adelphi has so much to offer and so much to give back to the students. My favorite thing that I have done so far is being an Orientation Leader, it was amazing experience and I loved every part of it. I also love that we have such an active Student Government, I feel that we really try to take part and show support for the different things going on on campus and come out for them. ",
                "Stephanie": "When i tell people i go to this school they normally put on a weird face or do not know where it is, which is great because whatever idea tey have i can either confirm or inform them more about it and change their mindset. At first i did not know what to expect from this school because there are a lot of misinformed ideas regarding it. It is located close to everything, yet it is in a quite and beautiful setting where one can appreciate nature and not be in a secluded area. My school is not very large, so it can be easier to make friends because you will see familiar faces around. But it not small either, so you will meet new people everyday! And there are alot of places where you can just walk and not feel crowded.",
                "melissa": "My opninion about this is school is that its great. The campus is beautifull and there are so many different extra-curricular acitivies you can do and participate in. The teachers are very approachable. You can take advantage of the school facilities at various hours of the day. The dormitories are clean, fun to be in, and student friendly( quiet hours, clean facilities, etc). There is diversity at Adelphi, and people come many different states as well as different countries. Classes are small and there are always on campus events that are open to everyone and range from different hours of the day to different days of the week. ",
                "Manisha": "I love the school. There are so many ways to get involved. The people are always willing to help you out. I spend most of time in the library, because it is open for a very long time throughout the day. "

The friends you go in with aren't always going to be the friends that you come out with. Change is good and you shouldn't be afraid of it. change is your friend. Be active, join a club, be a tour guide, join a sorority, study abroad. Make your experience fun! College is nothing like high school, you have to be prepared to be hit in the face with a million things at once. You may fall down once or twice but you will always get back up. Never doubt yourself. One bad grade on a paper isn't going to kill you, always speak up, find help from a teacher, there not the enemy there going to help you. College is a wonderful experience, you just have to be up to the challenge and work your hardest to achieve what you want.",

College is a place where if you have a question, someone could always help you with it.  Also, it is not as scary as everyone portrays it to be.  You will succeed with effort and dedication.  Stay calm and focused on your goal.",

First, above all, I would sit myself down and tell myself that no matter what happens, good or bad, do not ever quit school.  I would let myself know that the only path to a succesful career that will make me happy is to go to college, work hard, and graduate.  I would tell myself to be prepared for a big transition from going to high school in a small town like Commerce, GA to a big school in a much larger town.  I would tell myself to have confidence and not be so self conscious about every little thing, allwoing myself to not be intimidated by the \"largeness\" of everything on the college campus.  I would definately take a few moments to look myself in the eye and honestly tell myself that I need to relax, stay focused, and have a good time being young.",

One choice that I regret making was not listenin to my teachers and parents when they were suggesting that I apply for scholarships and grants. Just like many other college students, I am struggling with tuition. Advise that I would have given myself as a high school senior would have been, if I want to succeed in college without dealing with the stress of worrying about how I am going to pay for my education, I should be applying for any scholarships and grants available for me. If I could go back in time and give myself this information, applying for grants and scholarships would have been my main priorety. College is where I personally need to be for my best interest. My home is mentally and physically not healthy for me to reside at. By not applying for these scholarships on time, it is costing me the loss of living on campus at Adelphi University.",

You don't need to go to a university who's tuition is $50,000 just to say you went there. The whole point of living the college life is truly loving where you go to continue your education. I am a very shy and quiet person, but the way college is is the complete opposite and I'm glad I'm going to a college that is so involved and willing to help and make you comfortable. It's a home away from home and well worth attending.",

As a high school senior I received a lot of advice from my elders, teachers and parents but, it is truly better when you experience it for yourself. When I first came to college I was not sure of whom to talk to if I need help or had a problem. I decide to make myself familiarized with all my professor and centers on the campus that are able to cater to my needs. I made sure I knew who to talk to, what was going on and where to go. I will tell my senior self that I must be very attentive, productive and have good time management skills. These three skills help me to become a better student. I was very active in high school and I will tell myself to be even more active in college. By joining clubs, attend events, going to lectures and other extracurricular activities helped me to make friends and to network. Communication is key and also the best advice.",
                "Frederick": "Knowing what I know now, the best advice that I can give myself would be to vigorously look into scholarship and learn how to manage my time well. I would learn to balance my personal life with my academic life in order to succeed  in college.",
                "Audrey": "If I could go back in time to face my wide-eyed senior former, I would help her prepare for the challenges ahead by letting her know that she should never stop writing, analyzing or observing; and she should always have faith in the fact that her strong, rooted voice matters. As transitioning students, the end of high school is a time when many feel on top of the world (literally, as they are at their school.) When they enter a new institution, being at the bottom wrung again is a new challenge that can lead the returning student to question their current abilities and faith in their long term potential. It is my hope that by reinforcing the self worth of my senior identity that I would  avoid many of the traps of peer influence and media grandeur that let to setbacks in my education and professional life. I believe inside everyone has that strength and knowledge that allows them to excel. Picking out my bright spots and illuminating them for myself, especially as a representative of my future being, would secure my foot earlier in one of the many doors I eventually opened for myself.",
                "Jenny": "Making the transition into college can be a difficult task for any student. You are learning how to be on your own, how to manage your time, and how to take the time to study educational topics rather than study the art of partying. At the beginning of my college experience, I was 100% sure that I was ready to take on life. What I discovered was quite the opposite. I found it hard to concentrate, living with a random roommate in the dorms at Arizona State University. Everyone was always out and about going to parties and socializing. It was so easy to skip my 10:45 AM class when I had been out until around 5:00 AM. So, as I travel back in time to think of how naive I was as a high school senior, I can only wish to offer this advice: Think about what college really is. A university is a place of magnificent intelligence, whether you choose to see it is in your own control. Most college freshmen choose to see the simple joys of college, but if you thrive for the true college experience-opening your mind-you will find the world.",

I can feel myself growing and learning, going from a young and inexperienced high school girl to a more responsible and knowledgable women.

However, college has taught me that high grades alone will not help me achieve my dream.   It's easy to get a high grade if you cram the night or week before a test; true success requires a passion, a passion that needs to be fueled by others and, most importantly, by one's self.  My professors showed me how to create atmospheres, how to determine the psyche of a character, and how to expand my ideas.  I have learned so much in the short time that I have been at college that it is impossible to put a price on it.   I've learned how to create works that I can be proud of, and that is an experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.",

Because of the PRIDE Alliance, I was able to network with other individuals who had the same doubts as me, and I was encouraged to do what I could to make positive changes on campus.  Professors who are open and friendly helped me to become comfortable with myself, especially in the classroom setting.  Inspired, I ran and was elected for the position of Resdience Hall Senator in the Student Government Association.  As a freshman, I am able to bring my \"fresh\" perspective to the Levermore Global Scholars program and SGA, and I have given back to Garden City through the Freshman Community Action Program.

By going to school so far away from home and from all my family and friends, I have been allowed to experience the world in a way I may not have been able to before.  I have had to create new friendships from scratch, and establish myself in an unfamiliar place.  I have had to make the transition from the child of a sleepy town to a young woman in college, far from anything she is familiar with.  I have gained the confidence to put myself out in the world, to be sure of myself, and I have gained the power to try anything, and be unafraid of failing.  I have made the bonds with my friends and family even stronger than they were before I left.

I may have to leave the University by January 2010 because I cannot afford to pay the semester tuition, which is really disheartening.

Sitting there it occured that if you don't take chances nothing will come of anything. So i engaged in the art of conversation discovering they as well were reluctant to make the first move in their new enviorment.  The lesson of risk is what is most important of all. Getting out there and working for the better. No gaurantees no anything. Do or do not there is no try. So every day i try to get the most out of any situation.

I attended community college for a year, I finally chose the perfect major that fit me and also did great in school recieving a 4.0.

I used my time in college to discover exactly what I had been missing out on. During those four years my eyes began to open to the various types of arts and diverse cultures that society has to offer. I took finance courses that delved into the world of Wall Street, philosophy courses that introduced different forms of meditation and ideologies from around the world, english courses that flirted with the stories of Jane Austen, even religion courses that took us on feild trips into different places of worship. College is where I discovered not just what I wanted to for the rest of my life, but also where I found myself.

First off, know that you don't need to be as stressed as you are right now. College is a wonderful experience and you don't need to be as closed off to people simply because you are scared. The teachers are welcoming and there are many students that want to help you in this process and are going through the same struggles you are. There are very interesting classes that you will be able to take and you will have the ability to have more discussions which will open your mind and force you to think outside of the box that you have become comfortable in.  In doing this, you will develop into a stronger person with a confidence you have never known. Embrace this opportunity while you can and know that college is where you discover yourself and being there allows you to grow and become someone that you will be proud of. You truly can do anything if you are determined enough, and if you continue to think this way your college years will be a life changing experience.",

Whenever I complained something was hard, they have always told me that I should wait because it is nothing compared to the workload colleges give. This has always frightened me. It made me believe that college would not be right for me because if I cannot handle high school algebra, how would I be able to study college level classes? My parents are what made me want to persevere and pursue a college degree. I have seen them struggle to work and provide a better life for my brother and I. Now that I know what college is like, I would tell my high school senior self to work hard even if it is my senior year. It does not give me a reason to slack off. Working hard will help me grow as a person and help the transitioning period from high school to college a whole lot smoother. I would suggest myself to find a job so I can start paying my college dues instead of having my parents do it for me.",
                "Hannah ": "First step, follow your heart.  For one minute don't listen to your parent's, boyfriend's, best friends' opinions and just think about what you want.  Their is no need to hem and haw over two schools when you honestly know where you want to go.  It's your life therefore you should do what you want to do, realizing that will take a huge load off your shoulders.  The dreaded word, homesickness, is vastly overrated.  Of course any transition into a whole new environment is not simple, but it is also not awful.  No matter how much you love your safe abode at your parent's house you now get to make a new place.  Plus, the internet and cell phones greatly affect the amount of homesickness.  Don't dwell on the past and look towards the future.  Go into college with an open mind,  don't think about how people saw you in high school, it is your chance to be how you want to be seen by others.  You will meet some great new people, learn new life lessons, and start a new chapter in life so don't stress out and dive right in.",
                "Nicole ": "The transition from high school to college was a really tough one for me.  I was not able to adapt to change, mainly because I didn't want to, because I thought that everything was just fine the way it was.  This made me depressed and made my already difficult transition to college life even harder.  Given the chance, I would tell myself as a high school senior to accept change, and to thing of everything that is new, as a new adventure, because that is what it really is.  Finding a dream college is a long and difficult journey, but unfortunatly that journey doesn't end with the tuition deposit.  My advice to myself, and every other college bound student is not to worry about looking for the perfect school, with the perfect college life, because it isn't about being perfect.  College is meant to achieve a higher level of education, and you just so happen to gain life experiences along the way.  Change is inevitable, you have to be open to it.  Being able to accept changes will make getting used to college life a lot easier, because college is nothing like high school, for the better.",

I was always the high school student who did enough to \"get by\", I did enough to get honors but nothing more.  If I could go backwards and give my senior-self some insight, I would tell myself that life isn't about just doing what it takes to \"get by\".  College is all about independence  and, therefore, there is no one by your side to make sure you succeed.  I would tell myself that the hard work and effort starts here, in high school, so that the transition to college is a smooth one with room to really enjoy the experience.  I would tell myself that, in order to be successful, you need to stop settling for \"getting by\" and start reaching for excellence.",

Also, learn about time management because there isn't really enough time in the day to do EVERYTHING. When it comes to transitioning you will do fine as long as you be yourself because you're going to have your old friends at Adelphi with you and you're going to make a lot of new friends.  And try to attend one basketball or soccer or some type of game at Adelphi because you do want to be involved in every way. Dont be afriad to ask for help.

Partying and fun is good, but only in moderation, because there are more important things in life than just that. The end goal should always be kept in the line of sight, and that is financial and career success.  That end goal will be what will enable me to remove my family from poverty and give them a better future, and allow me to make a difference in my community. It will show others like me that there is a better way, and that success is possible if focus on the future is kept. That means more internships, more career-orientated jobs, and a firmer work ethic starting from high school, so that it carries over in college and in life as well, and enables me to achieve my goals and dreams to the fullest.",

I feel however that this is an unfair thing to question oneself about.  In order to honestly answer this question I would advise my high school senior self to appreciate everything and every decision I make in the future, for good and for bad reguardless of the consequences of my actions.  This is because I cannot possibly imagine wanting to face my former self now without any shadow of doubt in reguards to my present self.  Doing so would only enable the high school me to question every action that he may take from then until my current age of 24, wondering how things might have changed for the better or worse.",

Back in high school I was not able to completely understand the difference between high school and college. If I could go back I would have told myself not to focus so much on the social aspects of school but rather the academics. The academic part of high school is what primarily carries you to college. If you are a more focused student in high school the transition to college wont be as bad.  Plus the grades and ranking and scores on the SAT's will all help with the amount of money you have to pay for college. I would also encourage my self to be more outgoing and try new things.

Drink water. You'll be glad, especially at four in the morning two days before the semester ends. You'll feel better when you wake up after a half-hour of sleep or less.\nFind time to read.

I would also tell myself to look into the fact that the school  is either commuter or residential and take into account how much I would be able to go home.  Something that I really wish I knew as a high school senior was how expensive college really is and that I need to start saving so that I can buy any necessities and also have money to hang out with friends.

As much as MIT or Harvard seems wonderful, many of us have to be realistic and accept that there are less expensive schools that are just as prestigious. Another factor is the variety of courses/programs available for your major. Find the best one that offers courses that will be useful to your career. The size of the school is also important. Some students perform better in small classrooms than in a grand lecture hall where the professor barely notices half the class in the back.

None of them are true but they do exist.\r\n\r\nTheater Major's- The major with the worst reputation but the best people. Stereotypically they are viewed as a cult who only hang out with each other and sing and dance in the hallways. They are the resident \"Weirdos\". This is a 100% not true. Theater major's are just as diverse as any other majos. Some are in Greek life, others are in the honors college, some are involved in Student Government, some are considered very popular, and some are just regular weirdos. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise,\r\n\r\nGreek life- For those who take a chance and pledge a fraternity or sorority  be pared for the backlash.  People will stereotype you. Other students will think that you think your better than them, that your turning back on all your friends you made your first semester, that your changing, and that you will only hang out with your sisters or brothers now. All this is 100% false. People who choose to join a greek letter organization  do not change. They may grow up and begin to work better with others but they will always be themselves. Students who join an organization may no longer have the time the use to, because now they are part of something that is not only a social institution but a philanthropic one. No one ever just ditches there friends.  There just busy. Also depending on which organization you join you'll get your own personal stereotype. All of those are 100% false as well. But they exist to those who don't know. \r\n\r\nCampus leader of an organization/club-  People will think you are a dictator. That you have no intentions of bettering the club and are only doing this for yourself. This is not true. Your doing your job. You were elected to make decisions. People just need to stop complaining behind your back and bring it up during a meeting so you can take others opinions into consideration, \r\n\r\nAthlete- Soccer,player and honor student can be in the same sentence.

This transition was pretty seemless, as I was still living at home and not transitioning to life \"on my own\".  I do wish I could go back and talk to my high school sophomore and junior self, so I would have focused better on my academics then so that I would have been in a better position to take advantage of college scholarship opportunities, as they are far more limited for transfer students. I would tell myself procrastination is NEVER a good strategy and that good organization skills are a must. As for moving away to school, I will make that leap on August 17th, when I move from NY to Missouri to attend Mizzou.

Reiterating how I spent 21 years in the workforce primarily at the operative level. How I spent many wasted years enduring a false sense of pride by struggling to advance in my field of work with nearly nothing to show for it. Being self-taught has its advantages but not nearly as many as in pursuing a higher form of education.\n\nFinally, I would have pleaded with myself to take the time to research and write down all the pros and cons in the matter of attending college verses the reprocussions of joining the workforce without a college education.",

We have a church and landscapers that work on the campus grounds during the day and they help keep the campus beautiful. The housing is not top of the line since it's an older college, but there are plenty of places to go and meet with friends so you aren't stuck in your room all day. I came there to get an education and run cross-country and track and their weight room is state of the art, so that's a plus if you need to blow off some steam. They also have Segways that you can ride around campus in, but you need to do a training course before you can take them out by yourself, so I usually stick with the bikes. Honestly, I never get old of this place and I knew if I had to take out a loan I would do it while attending Adrian. There's so much bang for my buck. I am happy that I chose Adrian as my college. "

I lost out on connecting with professionals in my field, I missed out on meeting some great friends, and most importantly, I did not learn anything about myself. In my second semester I was depressed and wanted to leave Adrian College, but my roommate convinced me to give it one more chance. That semester I tried anything and everything that I could fit into my schedule, and while there are a lot of the experiences, I only tried once\u2026by trying them I learned insurmountable pieces of information about myself. It is through these experiences that I found out who I truly am.

The person or persons trying to establish a feel for a campus need to understand also that things change between seasons and from dorm hall to dorm hall.  Parents and new students should ask a lot of questions and expect an answer, do not hold back! If a parent is concerned about drugs and alcohol, ask the safety or security office; a sophomore alcoholic will deny any problems on campus to avoid the angry R.A. Students also need to research every aspect of the campus, from dorm life, to night life, campus activities and study groups. No question is too small or too big. Dig for any and all information possible that may one day affect the college experience. Again, feel out the campus, learn everything there is about the college up and down.",

I made the right choice with Adrian, even though it wasn't really what I wanted. The professors when I went to three different visits to the school sold Adrian to me. They are friendly, and they have and continue to help me with anything I might need. \n\nAlso would have told myself to take German and Japanese insted of Arabic and Japanese.

Don't assume everyone already has all the friends they need, you might just find out all they've been missing is you. Join a club. Go to a party. Study. Study some more. Finish work in advance. Don't procrastinate. Try your best, don't give it the minimum amount of effort, even if it suffices. Step outside your comfort zone. Try new and unfamilair classes on for size, you just might find your passion. Call your mom. Send letters to grandma. Keep in touch with your friends from home.

I have also learned that it is important to work together and accept others for who they are in order to succeed.  From my college experience I have discovered what it takes to make it in the \"real world.\" Attending this college has been valuable in a sense that it is preparing me for life after school.

With a little help of this scholarship it can help nourish the orange, so I can keep attending college in the future without any barriers to battle in my life.  I've battled many barriers in my life to get my assoicate's degree, but to keep attending college for another two years can be troublesome by balancing my family's financial situation.

In addition to learning my basic core subjects in my time in school, I've developed a greater understanding for the real-world application in which college will teach me. My classes have ranged from the science department, to the math department, and all the way to the communication department.

I think Adrian is the best school for young student athletes who wish to continue their dreams of playing college sports, but most importantly to get an excellent education. Adrian's classes are not only challenging but they are extremely interesting. I have not had a class yet where I have sat there in sheer bordem. That is the positives that I have taken with my experience at Adrian College.",

Most problems of the college transition can be solved by being prepared for future situations.  To do this, one must anticipate situations and develop a plan to overcome that obstacle.  Develop plans that you are comfortable with, and be able to react with them.  I would have also told myself to know the professor?s expectations from the beginning, so it would be easier to succeed in the class.  Teachers are much more ruthless in college, so I would say to come to class ready and on time, because it?s a good idea to be on the professor?s ?good side.?  Also, I would say to talk with people who have taken the class before and figure out the best strategies to doing well in the class.  Finally, I would have told myself to arrange my dorm room to optimize comfortableness, because most of your free time is spent there.  It is also a good idea to be able to schedule your meals accordingly, because no longer is there a pantry of food to snack on!",

That can be defined in many ways (ie, scholarships, reputation of program, distance from home, ect).   It is so important to go with your gut and choose the best place for you.  The student is going to be spending a lot of time there.   Go visit campus on a day when it isn't cleaned up for visitors.  See how it really is.  Don't be afraid to ask questions to students that go there.  They have the best anwsers for you.  The admissions people can be helpful, but  getting questions anwsered directly from the current students is a great way to get a feel for the atmosphere of the campus.  College can be a great experiance, you just have to find the place that suits you best.",

I would tell myself to concentrate on my time management skills, as well as improving my study habits. I would also tell myself to look into alternative options when it comes to studying.  It would be important to inform myself to broaden my horizons and be much more opened minded when I get to college. The most important thing that I would tell myself, not dealing with school, would be to concentrate less on the issues at home and concentrate on my schooling because, at the end of the day, my schooling will better my life and everyone around me.",

Be ready to feel as poor as a bum on the street because even if you have tuition paid off, those books will lower your checking account faster than you can blink. You think you enjoy your mom's cooking now, just wait till Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks when you get to switch from Easy Mac and pop tarts to some nice homemade cooking.  The classes aren't that great either. They are much different, and even though you never had to study in high school, you better learn how to study now. Professors can grade you how they want, it's their choice. Put school first, but still have some fun in the mean time. Don't forget about your hometown friends and family. Oh, and if you want to transfer, apply for as many scholarships as you can find because you won't be getting the ones you got when you were a senior.",

I would also tell myself to pick classes that double count for different requirements. That would free up a lot of time and I could take other classes I need. I would also tell myself to take summer classes at my community college because that would free up time for other classes here and I could get done faster.

Don't be such a Jerk to everyone, it's not their fault that you had no social life, it's your Parents. \nThen I would relay to myself that I should not stop my workout routine, it'll cost you big time. Don't join a Fraternity until you after your first semester, you ned to adjust to your new location first, and don't coop yourself up in your room, it'll cost you some amazing Friendships in the end.\nAnd finally, To my past self- Remember, your parents didn't go to college, so yes, they have unreasonable expectations. When you fail a course, it's not the end of the world, and they need to know that, because the harsh threats of not cosigning are a lot of pressure, and practice your trombone as much as you can during your Senior summer, it'll save you quite sime trouble.",

In order to get the most out of your college experience as a student you want to participate in extracurricular activities around campus along with doing your studies. For the parents, let your student have some freedom at college. If they are good kids they will stay out of trouble and the rough crowd.",
                "Colleen ": "My advice to parents and students trying to find the right college would be to first find one with the major you are going in to. Next you will want to explore how the college works for helping you be the best you can be. Going on campus visits to see how the college is worked most successful for me. I thought I wanted to go to a bigger school until I realized the perks of going to a smaller school and realized how much colleges are there to help you become all you can be. Also meeting with staff on campus who are there to help you is a great idea. Stay connected with people who help. College experience is very important when attending a college. You do not want to go to a college if you are not going to enjoy it. Finding a campus that is very involved in school spirit is a great idea. Attending sporting events and other activities on campus is a great idea.  Also any clubs you can get involved in within your College is a very good idea, meeting people and becoming involved are great ways of having a successful College experience.",
                "Ashlee ": "My advice to parents and students looking for the \"right\" school would be to find a college that has a large variety of opportunities as far as majors, activities and services (unless the student wants to go to a single-field based school).  \n\nFirst of all, I had no idea about which career direction I wanted to take.  In fact, I've changed majors twice.  A helpful and experienced career services office is crucial to any institution of higher learning. Just having that extra push can mean a lot. \n\nAlso, finding a campus that provides a large amount of activities is crucial. I am a commuter, so I don't have the opportunity to live in the dorms and meet people there.  However, I have been involved in two sports, numerous clubs, and classes that have made me feel like I'm part of the school. \n\nFinally, make sure the price is not too high.  Look for a school that is willing to offer scholarships to serious students. Once it is time to graduate those loans that were taken out freshman year start to look a little more intimidating.  \n\nMost importantly...make sure a good education will be obtained.",
                "Donald ": "My advice to parents would be to support their kids.   College is a chance for your children to grow  and shape their minds.   Don't worry so much about the costs.    You can't really put a face value on a quality education.   The prices may seem a little daunting for parents with 1st generation students, but you rarely have to pay the full value at your institution.\n\nMy advice to students is to be yourself.  You'll fit in a lot better if you don't pretend to like something to join a clique.  Most colleges are very accepting to anyone who wants to join a club or extracurricular activity.  Also your high school study habits will not work anymore.  You will spend many hours studying for exams, writing papers, doing homework, etc.  Finals week can be your time to shine on a class you had been struggling in, or time to fail.  If you do the homework and study, you should be fine.  There is always tutoring available if you can't grasp a concept.  And before you even attempt tutoring, talk to the professor.  They will be glad to help.  That is what they are paid for.",
                "Nick ": "This is sort of brainstorm writing, no organization, I'm writing as it comes to me. One thing I notice is that college students find themselves at college, everyone knows that. But a high school student needs to analyze themselves before going to college, if you try to find yourselve earlier, you can find where you best fit. Education levels vary from school to school,  but they aren't all that different, unless your deciding between Harvard and Eastern Michigan University, the education levels won't be too far apart. So what i believe is important is to find a school where you can feel you are most attracted to. A school where you believe you will gain the most knowledge as well as have the most fun. Half of college is education, the other half is being away from home, learning to live on your own, and learning to socialize and interact. If you attend a school you don't enjoy, you may still get the education you dreamed of, but you will miss on half of the experience.",
                "Kristina": "Find one that fits you both academically as well as sports wise, don't chose just for the sports team, its not a good idea.  And remember learning is the most important part but finances are also important to consider.",
                "Shawna ": "When telling parents/students how to find the right college and how to make the most of college experiences I would just say to follow your heart.  Of course you need to go on visits.  A day visior even overnight.  Visits help a lot because you get to feel out the campus.  You should also talk to the person who would be your advisor or the head of the department that you're majoring in.  It helps a lot to know if you are going to be able to connect with the staff in your field of study.  But like I said before, just follow your heart.  It is a very hard time trying to choose where to go, but you will always know inside where you really want to be.  You should never let anyone influence your decision or try and influence someone else's decision.  College can be the best days of your life if you let it.  It helps to get involved on campus to get the true college experience.  Once you do that I am positive that you will be talking about the college you choose for the rest of your life.",
                "Nolan ": "College is definitely an exciting time in a person's life.  The right atmosphere can make the difference in the end.  I would strongly encourage individuals to search for something that they feel interested in at first, then go and visit the campus.  Get a feel for how the college works and make a comfortable decision.  Do not feel pressured into choosing a school because of what other people want you to do.  When it comes down to it, people have to remember that they will be the one attending the school.  There are so many incredible schools out there, that all offer the opportunity to succeed later in life.  One of the best pieces of advice that I could provide is that there really is no right college for an individual, the individual is the right person for the college.  When I say what I just mentioned, I mean only that a person has the power to get what ever they want out of college.  They have the power to make the college work for them and have the simple choice of making it the right one if they want it that way.  The choice is always yours.",
                "Kristen ": "I chose a college that had the major I wanted as well two other majors I was also considering. People change their majors a lot and if you?re going to a college that has everything you are interested in you save yourself a lot of trouble.  \nI would also recommend taking a quick test to find out what type of learner you are. You can find one online if your school doesn?t have one. It only takes a couple of minutes and it?s really helpful. For instance, I?m a visual learner, which means I learn things by seeing them. I have a harder time understanding lechers than I do taking notes from the board. I can talk to my professors and let them know how I learn so they can help cater the material towards my needs. \nNever be afraid to ask a professor for help. It?s part of their job and it can really benefit you. If they tell you to get a tutor, do it especially if their services are free. Even if you?re not struggling tutors are very good for just reviewing information and that helps a lot.",

Doing both of these things will allow you to know if you feel comfortable on the campus and with the students at that school.  Take advantage of any scholarship, and apply for all possible.  When you are at school, make sure to get to know your advisor, and use any opportunity possible to have help making your schedule and planning your 4-yr (or whatever it may be) plan.  You are on your own, plan your time appropriately.  Do not completely forget about your social life, but make sure that you always put your academics before your social life.

I'm not saying apply to every college in America as well as Canada, but do not be lazy when applying to colleges/universities because you might not want to stay in your state; you might want to go to a private college; a small college; trade school or anything less than a community college. You want to pick a campus that will scream out to you when you step on it. Don't settle for anything less and don't have any regrets.

There are so many students with that focus or hobbie that in almost any kind of class there would be a time that a fitness type of example would come up. \n\nSo there are a lot of fitness driven people. The main style of clothing worn at this school is fitness casual or workout clothes because those students are often on their way to class, practice or the gym.",
                "Patrick ": "I wish that I had known the condition of the inside of the academic buildings, and I would've liked to known what a class was like at this college.  I also wish I had known the effort needed to excel at this collegiate level.  Before coming to this school I would've liked to known more ways to get scholarship money.",
                "Amy ": "I wish that I had known that I did not have to worry about making friends or the difficulty of college homework.  Every person that I have been acquainted with has been more polite than I could ever imagine, making Adrian College a very comfortable home for me.  I struggled to receive above average grades in high school and I was frightened that I may struggle harder in college; however, college proved to be equal in difficulty as my high school was and I feel that I have enough practice in the material that i can achieve it.",
                "Shannon ": "That the bowling team was a little bit better than it actually is.  Last year they had a coach that was really nice and laid back and this year we have a coach that is all new to this stuff and really strict.  I would have also liked to know that some of the lectures i wouldn't be able to keep up with the professor that was doing their power point, and that some classes were based on tests.",
                "Ashlee ": "I wish I would have known what direction I wanted to go as far a major. Although, the career servies department is really great and willing to help.",
                "Nick ": "I wish i would have been told how dead the campus can get, how a lot of people who go here are from around here and that many of them leave on weekends. Lastly how the education isn't worth the price of a private school",

                "Joshua ": "The worst thing about this school is the lack of housing options. There is an overload of students and a lack of rooms for them to be in. Along with this it is difficult to get off campus housing.",
                "Shannon ": "That some of the teachers here only have tests as grades, and I'm not a good test taker.   If they would give us more than just tests in the class I might have done better in class.  I am also on the bowling team here and we aren't doing that good.  I wish we had an acutal coach that knows what they are doing.",
                "Emily ": "We have no parking at all. All of our parking lots are filled plus some people have to park on the streets. It is not good. Also the tuition is pretty rough. It is very high and I'll probably be paying off student loans for at least 25 years after I graduate.",
                "Shawna ": "The worste thing is the food, and it's not even bad.  You just get tired of eating sodexo food for a whole year sometimes.",
                "Amy ": "Administration doesn't seem to be willing to help with simple things like parking avaibility.  They are overly conserned with getting people to come here then they don't have any where to put them once they get here.  They also claim to ask the students about issues, even though we find out later that they have already made up their minds.",
                "Kourtney ": "The worst thing about Adrian College is the city itself.  Adrian is the middle of nowhere and does not have a lot to do compared to USC, University of Michigan, or Ohio State. Students have to travel to Toledo, Ohio to go to shopping malls. Students also go to other schools such as University of Michigan, Bowling Green, Eastern University, or Michigan State to party. If the students had more fun activities in Adrian City we wouldn't leave the city or the state to have fun.",
                "Mario ": "I can't stand the apathy I see in students.  Adrian College is over 30 grand a  year, and I see kids skipping class to play video games! I think that students like that are foolish.   Also, I can't stand how the administration enforces the rules. They know that underage drinking goes on EVERY SINGLE weekend and most nights even. They do nothing about it. The kids get away with it! However, some kids used some spray paint on part of a statue that was donated to the college, and all three involved were kicked out of school."

                "Nick ": "A hard working, athlete who devotes most his time to sports and school. It isn't all that bad here, but the social life isn't thriving, it is an all athlete school and people normally from groups with their teams. So you really have to love the sport you play because it has to fill the gap that forms from a lack of social life.",

                "Devan ": "if you are really gung-ho about large classes, don't go to Adrian, if you like quick response times by Campus Safety, don't go to Adrian.  If all you want out of college is a party, Don't come to adrian, you can fail out.",
                "Amanda ": "If you don't care about your academics.",
                "Donald ": "A person that is coming to school to party should not attend Adrian.  There are parties, but there aren't as many as a large University would have.  The campus is practically dead on the weekend because students go home.  If you are the type of person that needs to be surrounded by many people, you probably shouldn't attend Adrian.",
                "Sarah": "A loud and obnoxious person who isn't there for their education and is only in it for the party.  The type that wants to waste everyone else's time and money by getting off topic or interuppting the learning process for others."

                "Emily ": "That it's small and like a tight knit family.  Everyone knows each other. The teachers know your name and you're not just a number. The classes are small too. The food is really good in our cafeteria and we have a variety of stuff to choose from every day. Most schools dont have good dining room food, but we do.",

Education is very important for every individual, prepare yourself for many long hours of studying and stressing. Although, collge is stressing it will lead you to a great future. At the moment you do not paying attention, you do not show up to class, and you do not care about educating yourself. Friends and cheerleading are more important to you, but when it gets to the point of paying rent and bills friends and cheer are not going to be there everytime your short on funds. I was always taught that whatever one does now affects the future. I would not want to see in the wrong road and advice you to stop being irresponsible and stop living the day without looking into your books. Life is hard and its either you study, pass your classes and educate yourself or keep the non-studying and be ignorant.

                "Comment": "Agnes Scott is a great school because it fits my needs and wants. I needed to go to a smaller school so I would be able to talk to my professors, and not feel intimidated to ask questions. I wanted my school to be in a great location and Agnes Scott is not only right outside of Atlanta but has plenty of other colleges around. I preferred for my school to be a liberal arts school, because I enjoy social science, humanities, and the arts. I also get the added bonuses of it being queer friendly (which, personally, is very nice for me) and the fact that it's a women's college adds a great dynamic to the atmosphere, and makes the campus feel a 100 times more safer."

If you're not a public school kid, you'll find you people.  If you're very artsy, you'll find your people.  It's a rather nerdy school but this manifest in a lot of different ways.  There's dweebs, pretty girls, kind people, quiet people, loud people, performative people.  A lot of diversity while remaining all girl.  I had a wonderful experience here. "

The largest class is probably thirty, so you get to know the professors fairly well.  The professors challenge you to do your best, but they are completely willing to help you if you need it. Since it is close to Atlanta,  the Scottie Shuttle System is an option if you don't like MARTA, but if you prefer to stay on campus, there are plenty of events hosted by clubs. Everything from cultural activities to sports games to scholarly talks is available for a student of Agnes to learn enjoy. "

I love how welcoming and open minded the people are here and how much encouragement you see between groups of women which is so empowering for me.

The atmosphere was nice and calm, and the teachers  took the time to answer questions I had about the curriculum. "

There are a lot of food choices off campus and the food on campus is ok. Let me be clear: at this school you are not paying for fancy dorms or parties 24/7. You are paying to get a excellent education and to make connections that are going to help further self development and career. Most of the professor are great. They are willing to go beyond to help and class sizes are small enough that you should know everybody. The tutors on campus are amazing, they are always there to help. One downside through, is there are only tutors for subjects related to mathematics, sciences, and economics. There are also writing tutors who are Great!!! They helped me get an A in one of my 300 level classes. That meant alot to me. First years do have the opportunity to go out of the country, that experience was unforgettable. Internships opportunity are constantly overflowing my email. I am personally glad I found this school.\n"

There could definitely be more POC on the professor side of things, and sometimes the school feels too small. However, the faculty are all so kind and very helpful. Decatur has some pretty cool things, and once you're over it you can go into the Atlanta area. There's not much partying happening on campus,  but we're close enough to other schools to find parties if that's your thing. The cool thing is that if it isn't, you just avoid them by staying on campus. "

I will be going to Agnes Scott College this upcoming fall, and after my few visits I have noticed many great things. The class sizes are fairly small, and are mainly discussion based. The environment at Agnes is great, all the professors and students are so supportive. There are so many clubs for students to get involved in, and as an athlete I am going to be a member of their softball team. The campus is beautiful too, so much greenery and beautiful architecture. However, the campus housing is not that great. The buildings are very outdated, and it is told that the elevators break down sometimes. Apart from the dorms, the classrooms are updated and have professors who will go out of their way to help you and make you feel welcome. I can't wait to attend Agnes Scott this fall!"

                "Comment": "I had to give ASC a one star ultimately because of how badly I was treated by the administration and how unhappy I was every day. In short, administration is all about money and your needs really don't matter. Everyone is forced to enroll in the ridiculously expensive meal plan that tastes like trash; the water tastes gross and hard. No effort is put into making sure your roommate is a good match, if you transfer in. It's a well-known fact on campus how bad the food and housing options are! There's a lot of red tape to get around for any disability or accommodation. Why? Because a student who gets a single room pays less, and a student who doesn't use the meal plan pays less. Not hard to figure out. \n\nOther students warned me that departments don't communicate - it's the truth. You'll fight to get every problem resolved, tuition adjusted, etc. Res Life is horrible and rude. They have NO idea what they are doing and they will do everything in their power to prevent you from meeting your roommate before you move in. Yet they act surprised when students complain that their roommate is a terrible match, ends up threatening them, etc. \n\nOff-campus apartments are a joke. Students are loud after quiet hours, they stomp on ceilings, blast music at 9 AM, etc. The Avery Glenn apartment complex itself is terrible, especially maintenance. The day I moved in, there was mold growing in my shower. I also discovered a leak with mold growing underneath my bathroom sink and in my toilet tank, and everything smelled musty. Appliances broke multiple times, including the freezer. Dorms are no better: they are moldy, students walk around half-naked, boys randomly come in, etc...I heard horror stories. \n\nDisabled? Expect to feel unheard or even to blame for your condition. Expect to ask if you're medicated (no, this isn't legal but they'll do it anyway). A counselor I met with blamed my personality for an issue I was having.  I wish I were joking. \n\nFinally, most of Decatur/campus is unsafe. My license plate was stolen off of my car and my headphones were stolen. Multiple students had credit cards/items/a computer stolen from the library. There were several reports of students being harassed by strange men wandering around. This almost happened to me once, but I was lucky to spot a campus police car on the same street. \n\nTo sum it up, ASC is an overpriced suitcase school with terrible administrators and average professors. The education I received was no better or worse than what I received in a public university and certainly not worth the price. ASC claims they're the most innovative college in America but have the most backward administration I've ever seen, not to mention SUMMIT is nothing special. There is nothing close-knit about the community; in fact, there are plenty of snobby girls who obviously formed their pack in freshman year and want nothing to do with anyone else. I was lonely much of the time.\n\nPlease, don't make the mistake I did -- don't go here. There is a reason that this college has such a high attrition rate for students and staff.  "

Agnes Scott has a small, tight knit community of women that are all generally friendly but so diverse that it is almost impossible to not find your niche of friends. Warm, kind, compassionate and accepting, these are all women who proudly support each other in individual endeavors, ready to lend an ear whenever someone has a problem that she/they need to talk through. The inclusivity of diversity was what made me fall in love with the college- I have met plenty of students who are from a multitude of races, ethnic backgrounds, faiths, and incomes, all interested in a variety of topics, from science to art, but firmly united in their passion for Agnes Scott. Agnes has a small campus that is impossible to get lost in (thank God) but still has wonderful facilities, my favorites being the library, science center, and dining hall. Located in Decatur, it's a short walk to the nearest MARTA station, which can take students to bustling Atlanta for a variety of local events and nightlife. Drinking is not very prevalent on campus, although alcohol can be found if one looks hard enough, and drugs are practically non existant. The health services are my favorite- several students that I know personally attended therapy sessions back in their hometowns, and when they arrived at Agnes Scott, they were quickly connected with local therapists who could help them cope with the mental stresses of life. For some students, Agnes Scott is a stepping stone for graduate school, and with the close proximity to Emory and Georgia Tech, many students find themselves settling locally after college. All in all, it's a wonderful, innovative school in a wonderful location, and if any female or AFAB student desires a small, tightknit community where she/they can stand out and shine, Agnes Scott is an amazing place to start.

It is honestly something that you can\u2019t understand until you experience and feel the acceptance that flourishes on our campus. \r\n\r\nA lot of students are from Georgia, and most are from the South. The regional differences between students play no apparent role in defining social groups as far as I can tell. Everyone is friends with everyone, as cheesy as it sounds. Additionally, the socio-economic backgrounds of students vary greatly. Because the school is so generous with financial aid and the Agnes Solution, it prevents the big price tag from creating an elitist environment. When I was visiting Agnes something I really loved was how everyone was from somewhere different, understood life in their own unique way, and brought with them their own flare from their background. It makes the small campus feel as diverse and interesting as the real world.

However, once I got here, I fell in love with the size, the campus, the professors, and the community. Everyone here is so supportive and helpful. All the students are also encouraged to do whatever they want and try something new. I'm a musician, but last year I tried cheerleading, and it was a great experience to be able to do that, even though its something I'd never done before.",

Because Agnes Scott is an all women's college, students here feel very supported by each other and we are all opened minded.",

                "Hannah": "There are benefits to a small school. Teachers know you is a big one. They know you and they want to help you succeed. They also want to help you to get a job. They constantly tell you about internship opportunities and job opportunities, even when you re just a sophomore. \r\n\r\nMy favorite classes so far have been my French classes. Professor Terry is absolutely fantastic. He knows French and he helps you to truly understand it. On the flip side, you can have bad professors at Agnes. One of the Most notorious is a certain Professor of Philosophy. She is super nice, but extremely boring. She makes the most interesting topics boring. Be warned.\r\n\r\nStudents study about as much as the party. Students on campus are fun loving and want to have a good time, but they are also extremely dedicated to their work., I mean, this college isn't cheap. I don't know why you would goof off when you are paying out the wazoo to go there.\r\n\r\nClass Participation is extremely common. People want to interact in class and debate ideas. However, be warned if your ideas are racist, sexist, or homophobic, because you will be cut off faster than you can say \"I'm Sorry\". Agnes faculty and students do not tolerate discriminatory things.\r\n\r\nStudents have a lot of intellectual conversations outside of class. It isn't lunch if someone hasn't talked about the oppression of the Patriarchy or how the most recent political scandal in Georgia is not surprising but here are all the flaws. \r\n\r\nStudents can be competitive, but not always. Grades are not a competitive system on campus, but that doesn't mean that some people don't want to get ahead of everyone else. The sports teams are super competitive in their division, if that's what you mean.\r\n\r\nThe most unique class I have taken so far is my history of the South class, Old South, New South, No South. In this, we talked about what the south is, when did it start, what is not the south, should the south continue, is the south already dead. Also, food.\r\n\r\nI am a history major and I must say that the history department is Flawless. It is run by Dr. Mary Cain. Her and her colleagues do a great job of trying to cover every aspect of history within a limited number of schedules. And each and everyone of them loves to teach at Agnes. there really are no bad teachers in the History department.",
                "Brittany": "Academics at Agnes are rigorous, yet attainable. Professors definitely treat you like young women who are maturing and learning in this environment. Though they have very high expectations of an \"Agnes Scott Woman\" they make themselves available to be there every step of the way to help students strive pass the stars. With the class sizes being so small, students definitely get that one on one connection with their professors. I can recall a specific time in a statistics class where I did not understand the lesson and the professor letting me know that they saw I wasn't understanding that particular piece of material and offering to help me outside of class as well recommending tutors. Which is another great aspect of Agnes Scott, there are designated tutors for it feel like every class at the college. This is great because when you reach out for help, the student assisting you has gone through EXACTLY what you are in the midst of; making them better suited to help you. With such, the education and the one on one attention that you receive while studying at Agnes Scott definitely help prepare you for the rigor of the real world! ",
                "Olivia": "Do professors know your name?\r\n     YES! And they'll ask where you were if they didn't see you in class!\r\n\r\nTell us about your favorite class. Least favorite?\r\n     My favorite classes are my biology classes :) It's my major. I love the professors, they are fun, approachable and very knowledgable. Lab is also really great, our labs are capped off at 20 people. My least favorite class was calculus. I picked a professor who taught the lessons in a way that didn't work well with the way I learned. I struggled, but she was great and worked with me outside of class to help me get a better understanding and to explain the material in different ways. Office hours and the Agnes Learning Assistants are great tools... and free!\r\n\r\nHow often do students study?\r\n     It really depends on the class. Some classes require more studying than others. On average I would say most students study from 2-8 hours on any given day depending on their schedule and classes. I try my best to get in at least an hour of studying for each class I had that day, sometimes more or less. \r\n\r\nIs class participation common?\r\n     Class participation is very common, it is rare that you only hear the professors voice for an entire class. Some classes even have a portion of your grade dedicated to class participation. \r\n\r\nDo the students have intellectual conversations outside of class?\r\n     YES! On and off campus too! Some conversations are hosted on campus with a special topic and moderator but many just happen naturally. \r\n\r\nAre students competitive?\r\n     Sure there is a small amount of academic competition but overall I think Agnes is more about the learning community. Study groups are popular, peer tutoring is encouraged. It's a totally different academic environment compared to what I experienced in high school. \r\n\r\nWhat's the most unique class you've taken?\r\n     The most unique class thus far was called the science of drug action and we looked at how a variety of drugs alter the brain and we each wrote a research paper and presented a 15 minute presentation on a drug of our choice. It was really interesting to learn about what happens to the brain chemically when we take things like advil. My project was based on the date rape drug if you're wondering. But I am also looking forward to taking a class called diseases of the nervous system this fall! \r\n\r\nTell us about your major / department.\r\n     I am a biology major and a dance minor. The biology department takes over the second floor of our science building. I love my major! I have a great advisor who is a biology professor and it's been great. We have a lot of great technology for biology labs (as well as other sciences) and our professors are very knowledgable. The dance department is so much fun! We have two nice studios. Our director is so dedicated to us and she also directs the dance company on campus. The company is mostly modern dance and we hold two shows a year on campus as well as make a variety of appearances around Atlanta.\r\n\r\nDo you spend time with professors outside of class?\r\n     I do! I spend a lot of time in their office hours asking questions about the material, help with homework or asking about summer internships. I've also been to lunch with a few and attended conferences with them as well. \r\n\r\nHow do you feel about this school's academic requirements?\r\n     They are challenging! But do-able! Agnes expects a lot from their students. Sometimes it is stressful but they provide so many fantastic resources to help you out. \r\n\r\nIs the education at this school geared toward getting a job, or learning for its own sake?\r\n     I think it depends on the student. No matter what it is you're looking at doing with your education you'll find advisors at Agnes who can help you get to your goals! ",
                "Lindsey": "The academic work load at Agnes Scott is very demanding. I spend at least six hours a day studying Sunday through Thursday. I\u2019m probably a bit of a perfectionist, but I can testify that if you\u2019re willing to put the time into your work you will absolutely see the benefits of that dedication. Additionally, if you ever need help with anything, the school goes above and beyond to accommodate your needs. There\u2019s a help center for all the math, science, and English classes, and tutors for languages and sciences that are free for students to use and immeasurably helpful! \r\n\r\nAnd the professors are unbeatable, plain and simple. I don\u2019t have a single friend from high school that can relate to my experience when it comes the relationship I have with my professors. Every single one of them knew my name and cared about whether or not I was in class and participating. They don\u2019t just want you to show up, they genuinely want you to succeed and want to make it easy for you to do so. They give a lot of work\u2014I mean a lot!\u2014but they are very understanding and always respond to emails and questions quickly. \r\n\r\nDistributional requirements (essentially the gen ed. classes you have to complete before you can graduate) were a major a draw for me. In my first year I completed my art, history, and math requirements because I wanted to get them out of the way. Now, as a result of this attempt to be done with classes I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of, I\u2019m interning in Washington DC at the Smithsonian in an art gallery in the history department. Basically, what the distributionals showed me was how important it is to explore outside of what you assume is your comfort zone. Taking classes like that is what makes education fun, it\u2019s what sets Agnes Scott and a liberal arts education apart from typical universities. \r\n"

Another popular event is screen on the green where they bring in a huge screen and we get blankets and chairs and sit out on the lawn eating popcorn and candy to watch one of the latest movies. Many of our clubs on campus throw fun events too. There is always something happening at Agnes wether it's a guest speaker, student performance, club event, athletic event or probo sponsored event. "

            "What is your overall opinion of this school? ": {
                "Olivia": "The best thing about Agnes, in my opinion, is our small student to faculty ratio. This was a big factor for me when I was looking at schools to apply to. I love that my professors know me by name and that many of them take the time to get to know their students. The size of Agnes is just right, for me, it's small enough where my professors know me, I know my neighbors and chances are I have a class with someone else who is on my hall. It's nice walking to class and being able to say hi to someone you know! Our small size allows us to function as a unique community, that's one thing I noticed right away during my first campus visit. \r\n\r\nIt's interesting to hear other peoples opinions about Agnes, from people who know the school I typically get, \"Wow! That's a really great College!\" or \"I know so-and-so do you know them? She loves it there.\" From people who are unfamiliar with Agnes I usually hear, \"Agnes Scott College? That sounds like a girls school. You go to school with ALL girls?\" but after explaining a few things such as \"Yes I go to an all womens liberal arts college etc.\" People want to know more and think it's a really neat place... which it is!\r\n\r\nAnother wonderful thing about Agnes is its location. We are so close to Atlanta and we have a great little town that is walkable. Decatur square isn't a college town but it isn't a ghost town, it's just awesome. It has fantastic restaurants, neat bars, great places to get froyo, coffee and cool little cafes to study in. Not to mention the fun shops, the wonderful yoga studio, the farmers market, and the MARTA train and bus station. And of course all the essential, CVS, Kroger and a variety of banks. The square is also home to quite a few neat Decatur annual events, they hold a book fair, live music and so much more! \r\n\r\nLastly, I really like our administration. Our administration puts a lot of thought into, \"how will this benefit the students.\" They love student input. They often invite students to participate as a student representative in various committees, they even have a few students sit-in on the meetings with the board of trustees which is quite unique. Our administration also uses surveys to gain student input as well. The administrators at Agnes are also well known people on campus, they attend many of the students events, and President Kiss invites students to her home and tries to learn everyones name! \r\n\r\n",
                "Lindsey": "I love Agnes Scott. I know every day when I walk around campus that I made the right decision. When I was choosing between different colleges I weighed a lot of factors. What I realized when I was making my final decision was that I had to first and foremost make myself happy.  I know a lot of prospective students, like myself senior year, are really afraid of disappointing friends or family, but just trust what you feel when you walk away from your visit. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but if it\u2019s the right school you\u2019ll know. \r\n\r\nI think the size and location of Agnes Scott are huge benefits of the school. I went to a high school that was at least three times as large, and the intimate feeling of knowing the faces you see around campus everyday makes every space feel like home. On the other side of that, Atlanta is easily the best college town I could ever imagine. Campus is small and cozy, but you can escape from that atmosphere and explore all the museums, malls, parks, concerts, and restaurants that the big city offers. Decatur is also a really fun area that makes not having a car not a problem\u2014you can walk to most store you\u2019d need as a student or you can take MARTA and get just about anywhere around Atlanta easily. \r\n\r\nOne thing any student will tell you is that you need to be proactive when it comes to your own social life. Agnes Scott is not a big party school, and no one is going to come to your dorm on a Friday and drag you out and about. BUT if you just try a little, you\u2019ll find that between the multiple other campuses in the area and the booming nightlife of a major city, THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW TO DO! There are a lot of concerns that boys are impossible to come by, but don\u2019t worry about that at all! Between Georgia Tech, Emory, Morehouse, and Georgia State, boys are always there if you want them and most of them are pretty fond of Agnes Scott girls. \r\n"

I also should have researched more on different majors and which schools offered them.  After attending school and becoming aquainted with Public Health classes, I gained a significant interest in this topic  over my major.  However, Agnes Scott didn't have Public Health as a major yet so this was also my mistake here.  In addition, I would suggest that you party less and take some college core classes within your freshman year instead of major classes.  Major classes are much harder and will damper your GPA a bit, so core classes is the right way to go.

College life proves to be hectic and stressful, and part of good time management is knowing when to say no to hang out with friends, to complete a favor for someone, or to partake in a campus activity. I would really stress pushing my limits to foster a greater sense of self-discovery. Trying new things, reading new books, and making new friends are all steps in determining who you would like to be as a person.  Failure is inevitable, and be open to learning and deriving positive lessons from your attempts to succeed. Also, it is never too early to apply to internships and try to secure a solid position for a summer opportunity in your field of interest. The sky is the limit, and your potential is enormous!",
                "Marlana ": "I would have to sum it up in three strong words, \"stop being afraid.\"  Take everything that you have learned in high school, and apply it towards college.  Go to college and place your best foot forward.  Take advantage of not having the worry of raising a family or working.  It's so much easier going to school and that's all you have to be focused on SCHOOL.  When you get older and have to juggle the kids, spouse, and work your time is limited in your putting the best foot forward.  Take advantage of everything while the brain is young and fresh, because once you get older it's not that easy.  If I could do it over I would have Dr. in front of my name.",

If I had more chances to earn money, I would earn more so my parents don't have to work so hard to finance my education here. If I had more chance to love the US, I will love it more.",

I would also tell myself to write down the things that I expect to get from college, academically and socially.  If these things are plausible, then I would try to meet them during my time in college. The last thing that I would tell myself is to not work more than one job.  Having a good college experience is something that you can only obtain in 4 years, and working hinders that. Even though I may not be able to pay for school without working, I should look for more scholarships in order to be able to actually spend more time on campus and enjoy myself and appreciate what the school has to offer me.",

It is not always so good to explore different schools year to year, so it is important that students look into their first choice schools more.  The students should look at what type of school it is and if their major is offered there also.  A students major is important to be aware of or at least an idea of what one wants to do.   Once a major or idea is known, finding the right college will become easier.  The student wasnts to make sure that they will be comfortable at that college over a long period of time so tours are wonderful.  Tours will help enlighten one's mind of how the college experience will be like.  Making the most of college should be fun, but also one should stay focused so that they stay on top.",
                "Rachel ": "To successfully apply to college and enjoy your stay, divide your tasks and goals between your head and your spirit. \n\nBegin the application process by creating a narrow list consisting of important college qualifications, such as school size, location, and cost. Next, start visiting campuses. Many schools can fall into a particular category (single-sex, hippie, fraternity-based etc), and in many cases college visits are the only method to ruling these schools out. Pick a school where you will not be indebted to until you are fifty and somewhere where you can do well. Academics are important; what you do with your undergraduate defines your future. \n\nDespite these guidelines, selecting and enjoying college should not consist of solely research and money. Pick a school because it speaks to you, not because of its grandeur or generosity of financial aid. When you get to the college of your choice, do not try to create a ?new you? that is different from who you were in high school. Do not try to impress anybody but yourself. Find fun things to do and create friendships to last. Enjoy your stay in college; what you do with your undergraduate defines your future.",
                "Lauren ": "One essential piece of  advice that should be given to both parents and students is to save now to prevent hardships later.  When choosing the right college be sure to also incorporate possible rising in tuition costs and a plan to counterbalance such rising costs. As the economy changes so does college funding  thus leading colleges to raise the amount to provide higher education.  My advice for students is to choose the college that qualifies to best suit what you are looking for in a college and to choose the one that fulfills the most features you are looking for (i.e. academics/areas of study, social atmosphere, class size, etc.). The best advice for parents would be to help your child choose the school that will allow and reinforce learing and self-exploration while not burdening your pockets for cost of attendance.  If both of these advisements are taken into consideration then both parents and students will have a fruitful and positive experience of college.",
                "C. ": "Make sure that the school is in line with both your goals academically and socially.",
                "Diane ": "You should find a school that matches your personality.  It's important to consider whether you need attention from faculty to learn or if you are motivated enough to keep yourself going.  Also, learn about the extracurricular activities available and take time to meet the faculty or students that run them.  If you don't get along with that person, it won't be an activity you would have fun being involved in.  If that activity is really important to you, that school would not be a good choice for you.   Either way you just need to consider the overall rigor of the academic program, the students and faculty you meet, and the activities available.  No matter how big a name or where it's located if it doesn't offer what you really want or you don't like the people you won't enjoy your time there.",
                "Morghan ": "From past experience, I know that trying to choose the right college or university is a huge step and it can ultimately define the rest of your life.  I know because I have gone through this very process no more that two years ago, and I almost made the biggest mistake of my life. \n     When it came time for me to choose a college or university, my parents told me that the choice was solely mine. Well, I already had my choice picked out: Spelman College. My father had gone to Morehouse, so all he would talk about was Spelman. So, naturally, I chose Spelman. However, something inside me told me to do some research. When I did, I realized that Spelman wasn't the school for me.  Please don't ge me wrong, Spelman is a great school, it just didn't fit me and who I was.\n      So my advice to all of the students is that you might have your ideal school pick out, but it might not be the school for you.  Go with your gut instinct. If something doesn't feel 100% right about the school chances are it's not 100% right for you.",

Most students here say that they knew the school was right for the the minute they stepped on campus- it really calls to some people.

Parents and students should visit as many schools as possible to help decide what kind of schools they prefer.  They should also look for scholarships and fill out financial aid forms as early as possible.",
                "Darcy ": "I think that going and visiting the college is one of the most important tools for finding the right college.  You can take an official college tour, which is often very interesting in and of itself, and then you can usually escape and explore the school on your own. Have lunch in the school dining hall and try to talk to actual students and get a feel for the campus.  A lot of colleges will also let you stay overnight in the dorms and sit in on a class, both excellent ideas.  And don't be afraid to ask direct questions, this is your future at stake! With that in mind, the easiest way to make the most of your college experience is to get involved in on-campus organizations and get out and see what the surrounding areas have to offer, but don't sacrifice your academic work. While having a 4.0 is not the most important thing in life, you will regret it if you get bad grades because you were out drinking instead of studying.  Moderation is the key I think, finding a personal blend of academic and extracurricular.",

Decide what size school you are looking for and whether or not you want a liberal arts college. From there begin to look at programs, extra-curricular activities, internship and study abroad opportunities, cost, faculty, etc. No one college is going to be so unique that you can?t find a lot of those same programs somewhere else. Apply to 5 or 6 schools you would like to attend and don?t have a first choice. Once you know whether or not you have been accepted and how much financial/merit aid they are willing to give you, make an informed decision with your parents. While I love my college, I could have received a wonderful education at any of my other top 5 schools. My experiences would be different, but not necessarily better or worse. If you have done your research, the school isn?t nearly as important as what you make of it once you are there.",

It's college we don't have curfews and boys are allowed to be on campus and visit etc. but there are certain rules and guidelines for safety purposes, during the first few weeks of being a first year you are asked to sign-in and out where you are going if it is after a certain hour at night and all residents (upperclassmen too) have to sign in their guests (male and female) if they plan on hanging out in the residence halls.

                "Miranda": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself in high school, the one thing I would tell myself is to get as involved as you possibly can. Take extra classes, even those included at local community colleges to get some credits and understand how college classes operate compared to high school classes. Get involved and experiment with different clubs or organizations in high school. This will help in college to see what kind of degree you would like to pursue, what activites you would enjoy being involved in on a college campus, and maybe even get a glimpse at what kind of a career you would or would not like to have. As for the transition to college, reach out to some of the other students you know will be attending the college next year so you can already have a support system on campus. The transition isn't always easy, but having friends there already can make it easier on you.",
                "Jessica ": "There are a few words of advice I wish I could go back and give myself when I was in high school to get ready for the transition into college. Firstly i would have told myself to try harder to keep my grades up, yes I had good grades, but they could have all been A's if I tried a little harder. And at  AIB where i attend school they give out scholarships based on your high school grades so with a little higher GPA I could have got more free money. Another thing i would have done when starting to make the transistion to college would have been to apply for more scholarships. Those are the two things i wish i could go back in time and tell myself to change more than anything. Thank you for taking your time to conisder me for this scholarship.",
                "Jennifer ": "Knowing what I know now about the transition from high school to college, I would have some advice for myself that would benefit me academically, financially, and socially. First of all, my advice would be to take harder courses, especially ones that offer college credit. This will provide preparation for a higher education and get you in the college mindset. Do not take easy classes simply because it is your last year. In addition, figure out your major so you can start to focus more on that subject. This will be beneficial both academically and financially because if you take the classes for free in high school, then you do not have to pay for them later. Also, I would advise myself to get more involved. Colleges love seeing students being involved. This is also a great way to meet new people and establish connections that may be beneficial later on.  My advice would not be that hard to follow, but it would have helped immensely in my college transition.",
                "James ": "As a college freshman now, I have come to realize that a good education comes from what you can get out of your high school years. I look back and I see that the more academic activities and volunteering  hours you put in, the more you will have a great grip on college life. Saving every penny you can, can also make a difference in where you can afford to go to school.  I spent alot of time at work and less time doing academic activities. Yeah I had the money but I didn't have the expierence I needed to make the transition into college life easier. So, you ask the question if I could look back and talk to myself about making the transition? I don't think anything can prepare you for the transition, it is an entirely different ball game in the real world!",
                "Kathlyn ": "The first thing I would tell myself is that it's an entirely new world, being in college.  The amount of freedom can be overwhelming at first, and has to be used with caution and responsibility.  I would also say to myself that it's perfectly normal and okay to feel afraid -- afraid of the unknown, of being away from home for the first time, and other worries.  Then, I'd let myself know that those fears pass,  and eventually, it all comes to you as routine.  It's just one of those transitions we all must go through in life, and that I'll manage, pulling through with flying colors.  I'd assure myself that everything would be just fine, and that yes, this is something I can definitely do."

Program options are available for students that have just graduated or adults seeking to change their career path. Options for different medical fields, to aviation, to agriculture.  Aims Community College is passionate about students,  student involvement, and the community they are in and often give out information regarding how to me more involved. Teachers always have office hours posted or make sure students are able to reach them with any questions and many teachers will provide extra tutoring if needed at times that are more convenient for the student.  Aims is an accredited school by the higher learning commission which focus on quality assurance and institutional improvement. Being able to attend Aims has been a great opportunity, the faculty have always been supportive with answering questions and accommodating meeting times for busy schedules.

My world got turned upside down when I got into college and I would want to let myself know that big changes are coming, but I really have to buckle down and push through it.

STOP ? and think about it. It may not be immediately pellucid to you, but what you think you should be doing with your life, isn?t what you should be doing at all. Do yourself a solid and look at the possibilities. Always strive to better yourself, get involved, and never ever let someone tell you that you cannot accomplish something. Kindness like laughter is contagious and if you want friends act friendly because it is this behavior that will make you college experience worth it.

Your mother instilled in you the work ethic and dreams of her immigrant past, continue to use them wisely to advance your own academic goals. Dedicate yourself to the next four years of completing your Bachelors Degree, time passes quickly. That degree will provide employment options as well as the satisfaction of knowing you have achieved your educational potential.  I married my wonderful Air Force Officer husband after two years of college. 5 children and 21 years of marriage later, I am still working toward my degree.

I know people are always telling you that, but if you actually apply it you will go to UNC faster than you expect.

Dont worry so much about what the other kids are thinking, this is only highschool.  All of this is such a small amount of time in the grand scheme of things in life and what happens in highschool is so insignificant for the rest of your life so focus on your accademics more.  Because the accademics in highschool are what set you up for the rest of your life, litterally.  What you make for grades in highschool carries over into college which will carry over into your adult career because employers will look at transcripts if its a big company.  So dont get so distracted and caught up in all the petty unimportant things.

I would change the amount of time I put into to school and my social life as a senior. Grades are so important.  Athletics in high school were so competitive but if I stayed in them I would probably be a compeltly different person today.  The high school I grew up in was all about sports and names, very poliitcal. It would be great to go back and do some things differently.  I am not sayting that I am not happy today, no not at all, I am extremely happy at how far I have come to reach my goals of becoming a Elementary teacher.

That college needs your undivided attention to go above and beyond just like your children will later in life.  Set aside any financial worries you have about college because the college will help you to receive financial help. Maria, you can do this because later in life when you have a family and a job you really care about that house that you and your family pray for will be yours.  It is a small sacrifice of time to go to school when you are single but it is so rewarding to feel like you are working toward something so young in life and an even greater feeling when you accomplish it. Later in life when you do have a family it is a very big sacrifice that your family gives so that you may succeed.",

I would convience myself that the debt of student loans will be worth it when I get a degree.  I would also inform myself that my body is not as indistructible as I once thought, hence doing physical labor will not be a lifelong choice and that it is not financially rewarding.  Therefore, I would say that if I want to be able to support my family, be able to work, and be proud of my career, I would need to further my education.   I would have to convience myself that college is not as scary a transition as one would think and that no matter the financial situation I was in, I could go to school and obtain a degree.

Smaller class sizes help students become known in classes whereas at a University your only known by a number.

Parties are always going on year-round , so if you want to fail, go ahead and attend the majority of those. \nTraditional housing - eh, you get what you pay for. Up-scale housing will cost you an arm and a leg, but it's worth it (larger living space, with attached bathroom)\nCafe food is a 50/50 on most days \n\n"

Some teachers aren\u2019t excited about teaching as they should be, AAMU hires anybody. The food in the cafe is horrible, and the people who serve us would sometimes carry attitudes."

I think if our student said positive things about our school when they mention there name then more people would want to come. I think we could use more places to eat on campus and places to maybe get things like pastries and coffee. Our transportation is good but i feel like there could be more days where they take us to the shopping places"

I\u2019ve recently just came from a tour there and I was with Midnight Golf Program and the encouraged me to buy in a application. I\u2019ve thought due to my gpa that I wasn\u2019t even good enough to go to school there or any other top school because I\u2019ve always heard a lot about that school. Alabama A&M University gave me the opportunity to view there campus and feel the historical view of the school and taught me about things that have happened there in the past life and current and I like that. The school is really nice though and clean and it seems like a family and I appreciate that from them."

The school has a lot of issues with discipline and whats really important. It seems like the administrations brains is like \"Students already enrolled? or prospective students? Eh prospective students are more important because we need there money so even if they transfer somewhere else, they cant. All because they wont be able to get there transcript without paying off their university bill. Oh, but hey who cares right. We're not the students, we are just the ones who feed the parents a load of crap at Orientation so we can get some more of their money.\" This school has too many issues and needs either some more funding or a whole new staff and hiring process.

The food is good , the only real downsides is not enough space for all of the teachers, and not enough out of things to do for students to do. My college doesn't proved breakfast lunch and dinner with good hours for all inbetween. Great transportation and provides an app , so you would know when and where the bus would be there . The college is good over all but it's just not the best place for me. "

I would ask more questions about the costs associated with each individual college and the curriculum needed to become an Occupational Therapist.\n\nWhile participating in sports and volunteer services, I would make a stronger effort to obtain references from teachers, my principal and volunteer coordinators.  Something I learned the hard way is that it is very important to follow-up on contacts you\u2019ve made.  I would not assume that because someone is an adult, they would follow through on references without a friendly reminder from me.\n\nI was a procrastinator in high school, always putting things off until the last minute.

College can get very tiring and stressful at times especially if you don't have balance, time management skills, and good studying habits. If you don't surround yourself with positive people there is a chance that you can be thrown off of the right path because of the partying, excessive work and lack of motivation.

For the most part, life experience is the only entity that helps us to understand and to grow.  One lesson I would tell my 18 year old self in high school is to let him know that at this moment in his life that he is not ready for college.  It is hard to admit to yourself that you are not mature enough to handle the stressors of college; some people can handle it, others cannot.  Joining the Air Force and serving my country for six years has been the most rewarding time of my life and helped me to grow as a person.  It gave me the discipline I needed to help cope with the importance of college and to help deal with all the weight on my shoulders.

By doing so, this will eliminate some of the anxiety that freshmen feel when they embark upon their journey as college freshmen.  Subsequently, this will afford me the opportunity to experience the level of reading, writing and creative thinking that is required to be successful.  Additionally, I would warn myself about the seriousness of procrastination.  It will cause undue stress and will not allow me the opportunity to showcase the quality of work that I am capable of achieving.  Finally, the last word of advice I would give, would be in reference to time management and how it is  the key to success  in whatever it is that you do in life.  Your parents will not be there to take up the slack, and you will have to be responsible for yourself.  With these critical pieces of advice, I would tell myself success is well within my reach.",

Second, I would join clubs, sports and organizations to gain more experience and extracurricular activities. Third, I would prepare and study the SAT in order to ace the test, to be qualified for my desired university, and to attract more scholarships to help me financially. Fourth, I would research and apply for scholarship opportunities online. Fifth, I would apply for jobs in the summer to have my own pocket money, to subsidize my colllege fees.

I loved going to culinary school, but I think that I could have gone straight to athletic training if I knew back then that's what I wanted to do, and I still would have been happy.

Even if you seem to be falling behind, don't give up.  If you need to refocus to get things done, just take a break, relax, and refocus!  This is going to be one of the hardest challenges you will put yourself through in life, but it is worth it, so don't give up.  Make sure you get yourself organized for all your classes.  This will help you stay on top of things, and not put off assignments till it's almost too late.  Your main goal is to succeed and all you need to do this is mostly to stay focused on the things that are right in front of you.  Take time to enjoy life.

Take advantage of the fact that you have some freedom and know that getting an education will make your life in the future much easier! Your son that you will be having at a too young age is amazing, but trying to get back into school while also taking care of him is one of the hardest things you will ever do, so stay in school and get it done now. Think long and hard about your major and the things you want to do with your life. Figure out the things that interest you, do not just go for what comes easy to you because it is not necessarily something you will like. Living on campus and discovering yourself are more important than going to parties with people that you think are your friends because they will not be there when it counts.

In pondering our past decisions and turning over hypotheticals in our heads, it\u2019s impossible not to also wonder what outcome our current decisions will have.\nIf I had it to do all over again, or if I could at least give advise to my high school self, it would be to work harder. No matter what we are doing we can always be working harder and there is always so much more room to grow than we realize. It\u2019s difficult at that young age of 18/19 not to get lost exploring your new freedoms and independence.

The reasons are discussed below.\n\nThe advice on research would be beneficial, as I should have conducted more research on larger numbers of colleges, programs of study offered, and overall college community atmosphere.  Each of these items is important to the overal choice of which college to attend.  Colleges and the programs they offer are significant to choosing the appropriate major and jobs linked to that major.  The college atmosphere is central fitting other students and establishing  a functional network.\n\nMentorship can last a lifetime.  It should have started as soon as possible upon entering college.  Networking and mentorship are closely related.  Mentorship  would have allowed me to begin the process of learning from and networking with a person who was established in his/her career.  Theoretically this person could have guided me throughout my career.  Fitting in with other students would have allowed me to establish a learning network.  Learning this before college would have allowed me to establish a viable network of mentor and friends that would have been beneficial throughout college.",

I would have told my self to apply to way more colleges and for way more scholarships.  I would have kept all my notes and binders from each subject; because your first year is like highschool all over again. Having better time management skills would help tramendously. Focusing more on my education than on a social life would have made things easier. Interacting with people with a different ethnic background; would be a easier transition in college. In college theres so much diversity and if your so use to just seeing one type of group its kinda hard adjusting. Studying alone and reading more in highschool would definately make me a better writer. The transition is so different in college all you have is yourself so getting a job and being independent would really ease alot of finacial problems once you actually get to college.",

First lesson I learned was that it is unfair to judge a school based on a few bad reccomendations, like with A&M, the opinions of others may not be truly reflecting the school's capabilities but instead those of the student/person giving the opinion.  My experience at this school has also shown me the benefits in being open minded and exploring new cultures and activities.  While at A&M I participated in many educational and extracurricular activities which exposed me to new ways of learning, having fun, and allowed me to interact (and form friendships) with people I may not have been as willing to meet without the influence of A&M.  The administration has taught me to be more responsible and \"take-charge\" through showing me that I should never depend on others to handle my affairs. Though I encountered many peaks and valleys with starting and finishing my college career at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University,  I truly can say that I have enjoyed the experience and the memories it created.",

While juggling my duties as a full-time student and mother I have grown tremendously.  My college experience has taught me  how to interact with people from all walks of life.  I have also shed my shy former self and now communicate better with others. The most valuable change since beginning my college journey has been my  developed  thirst for knowledge which goes beyond the classroom.  I now truly understand that education is a priviledge,  and the hard work and time dedicated to it is well worth the struggle.  My professors, classmates, advisors, and family have all been key in my transformation from someone unsure of my potential into a confident and serious scholar.  I am currently being refined as a college student.  I will emerge from my college experience as an amazing new version of me, just as the phoenix was reborn from ashes.",

I have always had a strong desire to help others and nothing pleases me more than listening and helping people. To show people that I care and see a smile upon their face warms and touches my heart.

Teachers reminded and treated students for almost everthing:  behave in class, bring your homework everyday,  get to class early or you will stand at corner of the room, and many other things.  College was different in a better way. The first day of class my teacher gave me a calender with all the assignments and test dates. My teacher said that eveything we would do was there and that there is no excuse for not knowing when something is due: That was something that I had never experience before; I thought it was cool.  College was pure responsibility. No more help and reminders from parents and teachers.  Everthing was up to me now: from choosing my schedule, looking for help,  and turning my assignments. These experiences helped me be a great responsible person. I got to meet great people from other states and all over the world. It was a great experienced and i loved it.",

Would you want to start college and continue classes that could have been taking care of in high school?? High schools are free, take it seriously, because once in college it?s mostly your money, and may feel more of an obligation.

Making one's self get up, and get ready for class in a timely and efficient manner is a very important key to succeeding in college. If you are not on time to class, there is no office to go to and get a tardy pass, which i visited frequently. The professor may, or may not allow a late student to enter the classroom. I would also advise myself not allow myself to only socialize with those whom I've already known. I would force myself to speak and interact with individuals I would not typically interact with. In college, there might be a lot of diversity, or a little.  Personally, A&M does not have much diversity, but those students whom are the minority, I almost never interact wtih. There is so much that can be learned from individuals of different walks of life, and it is a shame to rob one's self of such an oppertunity. Lastly, I would advise saving any and all extra money . College is extremely difficult academically, as well as finacially.",

If I was a high school senior, the main advice I would give myself is to be open-minded in meeting new people. People come from a wide variety of backgrounds and upbringings, and their rituals or sense of normalcy may include things that myself may not be accustomed to.  Another piece of advice that I would give myself is to make sure that I have goals and no matter what disstractions may appear, it is chiefly important to constantly remind myself of my purpose of being in school. With parties and many other extra-curricular activities it is easy to become more involved with other thing and forget my academic responsibility.  The last piece of advice I would give myself is to avoid pocrastination. Being away in college and not having someone constantly telling me to do something it is easy to wait until the last minute to complete things. With that in mind, it is important to set a schedule and do things in a timely manner to avoid stress. With this advice the trasition to college would have been much smoother.",

I?m sure most of your classes are electives and you feel as if they are not important, but they still count towards your grade point average. Colleges you apply to will look at your grade point average and it can also help you qualify for different scholarships. You need to apply to as many scholarships as possible to help you pay for school. I recommend that you spend a great deal of time looking into different colleges. You may have a particular college in mind, but you may find a school you like even more. You should also visit these different schools. Take a tour around campus and meet different students that are already enrolled or have graduated from that college. These students can give you better insight on the school. I know that a lot of kids? parents tend to put pressure on their child about going to a certain university, but the choice is up to you. You want to be somewhere that you feel comfortable.

Don't just go shopping because your parents put money in your account or  because you want the lastest fashion, spend your money wisely such as buying the things you need first, like books or food for your room. The most important is keeping track of deadlines, such as for papers or even applications that may need to be turned in.  Don't be afraid to have meet with your professors outside of class because you can get a better understanding. Don't let peer pressure get to you, just be yourself and you will be just fine.",

If I could do it again and talk to myself I would say that college is what a person makes of it.  By doing this, go to the college/university that best fits you, and not what sounds fun or a good time.  If the college/universtiy does not have  everything that you enjoy doing, diversity, hobbies, majors, or space then you may want to reconsider and pick another college/university that does.  High school teachers always put infaces on college, saying it is not like high school; but yet I find it exactly the same, but with more people, bigger classes, leasure, and most of all freedom.  Being an undecided major would have been alright, because then I could have found what really interest me.  The same work habit that I had in high school, maintain that, but just keep working that much harder.   Set goals and plans.   College is valuable,  you determine the outcome.",

At a community college you get to truly decide what you want to do with your career before you start taking core classes so just be patient and take one class at a time. Get involved in activities now in high school and when you go to colleg, do not be afraid to go out of your comfort zone. Make sure to learn good study habits now and have good time mangament skills so you will be ahead when it comes to studying for those hard tests. Enjoy this time of knowledge and be patient knowing that you are preparing for your future and your legacy",

The free time you have do not use it texting and partying around, use that time to work on the mistakes you have made on work you have donein class. The mistakes you have made on subjects in class, you will make them in college if you do not take the time out your day to correct them. I would even tell myself to be more ambitious in trying to find a way to succeed instead of depending on people. I would say you need to strive to get where you need to be in your educational life. You can not depend on everyone to hold your hand and help you through every downfall you have, you are going to need to learn and be able to handle things like the young adult you are about to become in less time than you think.

Go to a four year college, pick a good major, meet as many people as possible, learn as much as possible, graduate a happy human being, and get an awsome job.",

Make sure you fill out all forms and applications you need in order to attend a college of your choice with no worries. Another thing I would have to say is that you must keep up with your studies. So many of my classmates either did not know the lessons we were reviewing over or they just totally forgot how to do it which greatly affected their first semester grades. The most important aspect I would have to tell you is that you must truly take in everything your teachers tell you about college life. They were not lying. You should feel relieved that your math teacher talks to you and your classmates everyday about the college life, prepares you for lessons that she knows college will teach, and how a GPA in high school is nothing to brag about once you enter college because it is a whole different ballpark. Please don't let me scare you though, college is a great experience."

I I live in Philadelphia so being in Philadelphia there aren't as many programs as there are another States. Throughout my life I would like to explore an adventure and figure out what it's like to be on my own. Since Alabama State University is a hbcu high school I wanted to go because it is also the top college. Because I live far away I'm working hard everyday to apply for at least two scholarships a day so I can achieve the goal to go to my dream college. "

                "Comment": "I attended ASU for only one semester before leaving. My experience was that a significant amount of people were dissatisfied with having chosen the university, and were attempting to transfer elsewhere. In my dormitory (MLK Hall), there were several people who were disgruntled, and fomenting plans to leave the university. \n\nThe condition of the dorms were terrible. It was something you would expect from a third-world country.  The vast majority of the dorms were extremely dirty, and run down beyond belief. There was dirt on the floors and walls, and the elevator was full of dirt, and always broken down. There were one or two new dormitories on the campus, which were reserved for Juniors and Seniors, but they were being actively torn apart by the students living in them. It was very common to find trays of food sitting in the hallways or stairwells.\n\nMost of the buildings on the campus were also run down -- although they were in better condition than the typical campus dormitory. The were two new buildings on the campus -- the Student Center and the Library. The students were destroying the furniture in the \"new\" Student Center by cutting holes into it and pulling out the cushions. The Library seemed to be the only building that students were not destroying. \n\nThe university's cafe was in decent condition, but it was not sanitary due to students leaving their plates on the table, and expecting others to pick up behind them. I often had to push abandoned plates of food out of my way, in order to  have space to dine. \n\nThe professors were pretty well educated, and did their jobs very well. However, the university's bureaucracy was extremely disorganized and very slow moving. The university's staff was generally disinterested in helping students, and very dismissive, while lacking a sense of urgency. \n\nThe positive thing about the university, is that it had a pretty vibrant campus life, and there was a significant amount of pride for the university among students and alumnus.  Usually, there was always something to do on campus, and there were very interesting people to meet and to get to know. Initially, I overlooked the shortcomings of the university, because I was having such a good time. However, I would advise prospective students to visit the university, and take all considerations into account before making a decision. Remember that your future is at stake.\n\nI will note that when I attended, there was a sincere and concerted effort by Gwendolyn Boyd (the \"then\" new university president) to fix the conditions, and she was making enormous progress. However, against the wishes of students, she was fired by a very short-sighted Board of Trustees. \n \nMy best advice is to make sure you know what you are getting into before attending this university. I am giving you honesty, so that you can be clear-sighted, and able to make an informed decision. Understand -- this is a university that accepts nearly everyone! Therefore, it inherits some of the most troubled students -- students who do not belong and are not prepared for college. It accepts students that few other universities will accept. Although the majority of students are intelligent, well-mannered, and serious about obtaining an education.....the culture of the university is shaped by its worst elements.\n"

Everyone is like one giant family here and there is rarely drama. The center is academics and the professors really focus on academics and excelling verses grades and passing you to the next class. The food could be better and I feel like our buildings need remodeling because they are underfunded, but aside from that the housing is good and I love being a student at Alabama State University!"

I believe my school could use an upgrade with on campus housing and with buying new space to expand on campus housing. Our cafeteria food is horrible, except when we have wings. "

Before I came to Alabama State University, I was a little to dependent on my parents to do things for me. Once I got to Alabama State University, I had to figure things out on  my own, because I was so far away from home. I had to learn how to manage/ save the money I did have, that a received from my refund checks. I also had to learn that not everyone is going to be your friend and I had to learn that the hard way. You have to realize you came to college for one person and that is to get a degree, so that you can have a good paying career in the future.  I also lost my grandfather my freshman year of college, and that was the hardest thing that I had to adjust to. Not being able to say goodbye before he past made me the most upset because I was so far from home, and I would have not made it back in time to say goodbye. "

I had no more direction than a blind man walking into a crosswalk, and it took me nearly 8 years to figure out what to do. As a result of not knowing what direction to go, I have amassed a large amount of student loan debt and lost time through transferring from school to school. This is a paradigm that my peers and I can identify with due largely in part to being pressured into pursuing post-secondary education before having an endgame in mind; though they may be successful in their academic endeavors, they do not understand how to effectively transition out of the \"in-school\" frame of mind. So, to myself, I would pass along the abstinence mantra: WAIT. While you wait, work, or go to the military just so you can actually gain some experience doing something until you meticulously figure out the particulars and, most importantly, develop an exit strategy. Post secondary education can be a money, time, and resource trap if you do not plan accordingly to take care of those things before hand.",

I would tell my senior self that grades are extremely important and no matter how easy the class is I cannot slack. Also that I should never lose my passion and confidence for soccer.

You carry the reputation of yourself and those who raised you, so your decisions should be honorable. Don't skip a class because you are bored or just don't feel like going. Make plenty of friends who are willing to study with you. Sign up early for your classes, because if you don't, you will regret it later. You also have to take on the responsibility of finding yourself work, appling for scholarships, and getting moved into an appartment.

The next thing I would say are to keep up with the money you have coming in from your  FAFSA many times the school can loose your information or either the computer system can shut down. Make copies of everthing you recieve becasue the school will be quick to say that they do not have that information on file. If schools had someone to file paper work and also keep it on the computer I think the world would be better becasue you know that they have two copies of everything and you would also have one.  If i could go back and rewind my life I would becasue the things I have learned , if I just got the chance to do that I would and I will tell people be careful about the decision that you make .",

If you stress things will only get worse. So, the best thing is to use your times wisely.\n     Also,  learn everything and listen to what your paarents say. They know best. Expect nothing from no one. You are going to college for a degree nothing more. After that, everything will fall into place. Dont worry about anything that doesnt help you in your future.

I would explain the value of a dollar and the importance of understanding financial aid.  Then I would advise myself that home sickness is real and the further I am from home the more I will miss Rochester. Perhaps we would have a discussion about the importance of health so my early 20's would not be spent in doctors and hospitals. Most importantly I would tell myself to choose an institution that best suited my needs and dreams. A school that is beneficial to the advancement of my intelligence.

You will meet so many new people, some temporary, some long-term, but in the end the person who matters the most is you. When you mess up you you will disappoint yourself more than anyone else, so don't mess up. Take advantage of every opportunity placed in front of you and don't be afraid to reach a little further beyond your original goals, because the peak of greatness is always growing. The parties, the socializing, these things will always be there in every stage of life with different groups of people but this is your chance to make this experience everything you want it to be and to come out on top. No matter how close to the bottom you are you haven't touched it yet.\" Because figuring out college is hard to do, especially alone.",

The woman, who dreamed to become a doctor, has settled for life as a nursing assistant. Living a productive live, however it is not the one she dreamed of. Then, I would portray a woman with discipline. This woman is consistently working towards something. She is active in her community, physically admirable, and progressing well in her desired field. She has the blueprint to success in the palm of her hand and she is building a legacy. This vision would allow my younger self to establish lifestyle changes that would develop and create a better woman. If the life lessons I learned could be applied before the hardships that taught me, I would be unstoppable. This would help my transition to college by improving the mental focus that I lacked.

The people you meet at Ivy Tech will know what your true dream is before you do. You will meet an amazing, incredibly inspiring mentor and a wacky, super talented instructor that will change your life forever. Listen to them. Don't be afraid to take a few chances.

Although their main concern is deliever the information to ensure you recieve the best education as possible , college professors are not on you all the time about turning in assignments and completeing work and their is almost never a second chance.  Studying and staying ahead is a very important key point in colleges because once you are behind its hard to catch back up. I wil also tell myself to keep my grades up freshman year because alot of freshman do horrible their first year of college simply because they have trouble with the transiton .

Don't wait 5 years just to go back to college and to stop procrastinating on the things that are really important to me in LIFE. Knowing now that life is rough outside of highschool and very difficult to handle, but if I was to make a difference and behave in school, get good grades, listen to my teachers I know that college would have been a breeze if I just focused on my GOALS.

Know that it is ok to have some fun, but do not go overboard. Class in the morning is more important than staying up late. It is not about having all this freedom, it is what you do with it is what counts. DO not be influenced by slackers and keep your head high when people try to knock you down. Do not denounce your values and beliefs for anyone. Respect and get respect. Lastly, just be yourself. You stand out more when you are different and let your inner light shine bright!

Please do not let the boys get to your head and betweeen your legs. Your education is more important than the parties and boys.

Be sure to practice time management skills before you get to college, because once you\u2019re in college you have teachers that really don\u2019t if your paper is late or if you didn\u2019t do your homework. I would have told myself to study for the college entrance exams. Without these it\u2019s nearly impossible to get into a good school or the school of your choice.

It is very important to make sure that you do not wait too late to take the SAT/ ACT, to make sure you have ample time to take the exam if there is a need to improve your score. Make sure you keep your GPA in good standing \n Most importantly, schedule an exit meeting with your guidance counselor to get information about various scholarships, and information on various colleges and universities. Get involved in community service work because you can develop skills that will help you in college such as time management, organizational, and interpersonal communication.

I would also suggest to myself to actually sit down and look for as many scholarships there are possible so that it would be easier on the financial status of the family so that i may attend college. College is a very expensive experience and can become very stressful without the appropriate funds to finance such an oppurtunity.

As a first year in college Alamance offers an amazing curriculum based on your major. An if your undecided, advisors and administrators are there to help you explore and experience new things.  The environment is pleasant and the campus is great. Alamance is a great school to attend to and the cost is great as well. I love being a part of a great school and being involve with such a great college community. "

Was that a choice for Destiny!! ??  The Horticulture Department has received numerous awards from National and State interests and the faculty are well-known and respected by their peers across the country.  For a small college, we were the NUMBER 1 Community College for Horticulture knowledge and skills in the nation in 2015 at the national competition.  We even beat out 4-year agriculture universities to garner the 7th overall college in the nation.  Not Bad...go to school; it will change your life."

I knew I wanted to go ahead and begin my general education, but at the same time I didn't want to start paying the high end prices of universities. Then someone brought up the idea of Community College. At first I was a bit opposed just because I was afraid of what other people who were already accepted and learning would think of me, but now after graduating from there I am so glad I went. Alamance Community College is a really great school, they have amazing classes as well as some pretty great teachers who are always there for you."

                "Margaret": "I would tell myself to seek help from anyone and everyone from the College. As an undergrad student I did not know exactly what I wanted to do, and that was where I was at fault. I should have seeked help from the college career center and other resources to help me decide what my major should have been and what I would really love to do as a professional adult. I feel like I chose the wrong undergrad major, and I hate that it happened that way. Now I am in a career that does not interest me at all and I hate it. It breaks my heart that I am not doing something I LOVE to do... I want to be able to be in a career that is exciting to me and where I can encourage others to be motivated. That is why I am trying to go back to school and receive a degree in Accounting. But of course, since I did not make the right decision before, it is even harder for me to try to go back to school now because now I am an adult and have to support myself financially.",
                "Siobhan": "As a student whose primary challenge has always been organization, my advice to myself would be to always plan ahead. A college student's life is so busy that it's easy to get distracted, to put off tasks, and to procrastinate. However, procrastinating makes tasks seem much more insurmountable than they are in reality. It also has a tendency to back one up against deadlines and make it that much more difficult to complete tasks. Nobody does their best work under stress and time pressure, and I am no exception.\n\nTherefore, I would advise my high school self to be very deliberate about planning tasks, school work, and extracurricular activities. Achieving a good balance of work, school, and leisure activities is crucial to success and mental health. I would also advise myself to do a little bit of everything each day. No day should be completely without \"me time,\" but on the other hand, no day should be entirely without work, either. Parceling out tasks so a little bit is completed each day also would allow me to build mastery on a regular basis, thus enabling me to do consistently better work.",
                "Amelia": "If I could go back in time I would tell myself to start at the school that you are most comfortable. I started out at a different college and almost dropped out because it was not a good fit. I would tell myself there is no shame in starting at a two year school if it is the right fit.  Looking for small classes with students who are at the same point in life as you is really important. Having professors you can connect with and a student body you feel connected to makes all the difference in the world. That connection to the other students will help you achieve your goals and stay sane through the semester.  Study groups and tutors will completly change your college experience and help you pass classes and understand the information. Following your heart is key in a successful college experience.",
                "Abigail": "Hello, Self! Has it been two years already? I'm just dropping by to give you a bit of advice. First,  please don't worry! I promise it gets better. Your doctors diagnose you with Celiac Disease and Type 1 Diabetes a few months after graduation (Yes, you graduate!). I know this doesn't sound like exciting news but it is! It explains why you're always sick and missing so much class! Speaking of class, you probably already know that you're going to be spending two years at community college and I know you're not thrilled. Again, though, don't worry! It ends up being a great experience and you make some awesome friends and meet some awesome professors. Also, since you're no longer sick all the time, you begin excelling in your classes and even end up in a couple of honor societies! The best part, though, is that, after two years of all of this hard work, you get accepted into UNCW! I hope this shows you that, despite your fears and doubts, life DOES get better!",
                "Ellen": "The advice I would give myself is to focus more on school. Apply early for scholorships. Work harder in math. Try out for cheerleading earlier. I wasn't focused in school as i should have been. As a result i had to move down south with my aunt and uncle. I wasn't able to afford the university that i applied to and was accepted. I cant cheer for the potsdam bears. Its alot easier to get everything out of the way in the begining that way in the end you have time to have fun and enjoy being a senior. You'll have plenty of time to goof off. Also apply for a foreign exchange student earlier. So you'll have her longer.",
                "MARLY": "If I could go back to my senior year, first and foremost I would kick myself in the butt for not sufficiently caring about my grades. Secondly, I would hope to make myself understand (I was very stubborn back then) that though having friends and enjoying time with friends is a wonderful thing, it is not the most important part of college life. I would hope to express how important it is to not only work hard but to push through the difficult times. I would also encourage myself to participate in all the sports I was too timid or self-conscious to join. Most importantly, I would advise myself to prepare for the life altering car accident that is to come all too quickly. I would implore myself to fight through the pain, accept the wheelchair and not take two years off of school, but to continue with my education as soon after. I do not wish to avoid my car accident so I would refrain from giving specific details that pertain to it. It has shaped me into the strong and resilient person I am today. I wouldn\u2019t change who I am now even for that.",
                "Amy": "I would tell myself to try a lot harder and put in the extra effort to do my best and not just the bare minimum. I would say to study more and be more involved with my school. I would tell myself to not be afraid to ask questions, because that is how you learn. I would say that I should've spent more time studying so that I could have graduated higher in my class. Most importantly, I would tell myself that even though I think that this is the worst time of my life, I'm going to miss these times so take advantage of the fun things I have the opportunity to do. Although I didn't try as hard as I wish I would have in high school, I have learned from my mistakes and have pushed myself to do better in college.",

Then lay out a plan to get my degree.  This way by the time I get to be 30 I will have had a good 8yrs of working to build stability with credit.  Education is the root to a good stable life."

It's a school that has a growing health science department which is very astonishing, especially supporting Native students- APU has many funding options and programs to choose from and does not cater towards any age group. Spinney people in my classes come from a variety of backgrounds and they're all there to learn. Many of the professors come from all over the United States and apply much of their skills to small class settings. We have active learning which allows for more outdoor opportunities and experiences that are unique to APU."

On average there are about 10 students to one teacher so students get to know professors on a personal level and can get help easier. Then there is the active learning. Students have class on glaciers, mountains, under water and on the beach often. Classes are very hands on and teach students what they would actually be doing in the field.

Once you decided your major or area of focus the class sizes decrease and the teachers definately know your name and what your goal and passion is.  The faculty is very supportive.  I am a communication major.  The most unique class I took was Intercultural commuication with an emphasis on understanding Japanese, Alaska Native, and Mexican cultures.  It was insane how different all three were and I learned so much about Alaska Natives!  I grew up in Alaska and the things I didn't recognize about beliefs and how they influence behavior was amazing.  Anyways, my least favorite class was ECON!!  It is a degree requirement so have fun.  The school's academic requirments are very similar to all the college requirements. There are a lots of classes you have to take to earn your degree.  "

The students are never pushed to the point where they are uncomfortable in the class room setting.  The biggest complaint is the lack of transportation to and from campus.  There are shuttles on campus and I believe there is shuttle transportation off campus but only at certain times.  This cause issues if you need to go to the grocery store when it is -40 outside in December.  You can usually bum a ride from your roommate if they have a car or a friend of a friend but still, I would seriously consider an investment in a practical used car if you go to this school.  The school has a lot of school spirit and pride especially when it comes to the university's hockey program.  The games draw good sized crowds of a couple thousand and the game's are fun to watch.  Most of my time is spent at the Wood Center and the library, of course.  The Wood Center has a Taco Bell, a sushi cafe, a place to buy fruit smoothies, coffee, cheeseburger, whatever you feel like.  There is also a pool lounge, a bowling alley, and a big screen TV where you can go watch sunday NFL games if you like football.  The best thing about this school is all the intramural sports like soccer, tennis, flag football, and basketball that the university organizes because it gives you a chance to meet new people that enjoy similar activities."

There are many opportunities out in the world and having your college education right out of high school is the best choice you can ever make! Four years out of your young adult life is worth it to get your education NOW! Don't start college later in life and stunt your foundation for your future!  \n\nGoing to college is setting a foundation for your long future ahead.  It is difficult to go to college later in life because you have so much other things to worry about.  It is easier to begin college right after high school.

                "Janice": "If I were a senior in high school and considering going to college, I would prepare for  it  by doing several things.  First, I would spend some time with a career counselor.  I would take some tests and evaluate the results matching up aptitudes with career requirements.  Then, I would research several career options based on what I enjoy doing, what kind of talents I have, and what the career counselors suggested. In my research, I would explore what classes would be required, how long it would take to achieve the degree, which colleges or universities offered that career, how much it would cost, and which college had the best rate of graduates finding employment.  After I decided which college and career, I would work on the financial reality. How would I afford it and would I need employment to pay for the expense. One of the issues that students face in starting college is a new environment with a host of new faces and social opportunities. It is important to prepare ourselves to relate to the differing values that come with students and instructors.  Establishing a positive set of values is imperative before attending college.",

I would tell myself to explore my areas of interest and not worry about where or not I was getting credit for it. I would tell myself that college is a great opportunity, but that I should wait a few years to discover what I wanted in learn in college.

Now that I'm finished with my first year of college I would definitely like to go back and prepare myself better. I would warn myself to be careful of all the freedom college comes with. I didn't do anything crazy, but it was a big change to have time to do whatever you wanted and go wherever without telling your parents. I spent money however I wanted and it was a big change for me. I would also tell myself to learn how to listen in lecture type classes. I have always been a good listener, but I need to focus on not daydreaming or drifting off topics especially when I got bored. Another big lesson that I learned in my first year would be to study more and try different ways of studying. Everyone learns in different ways and sometimes they can help you learn something just by saying it differently.",
                "Bace": "Don\u2019t pass up opportunities. There are so many amazing things that you can do! All you have to do is gather up the motivation to do so. Not only through the school offered programs, but just in life itself. Also, if you need help, don\u2019t be afraid to ask. Your professors and friends are more than willing to give you advice and point you in the right direction. Rather than wondering where to go and trying to figure things out yourself, just ask. I know that you like to figure things out yourself, but it\u2019s ok to ask for help sometimes. \nStaying focused on school is going to be hard because of friends, money issues, work, family, and everything else. Just try to put time aside for school only and don\u2019t let anything get in the way. Remember that you are paying for it, and by missing a class or doing bad you are wasting your money. You might as well get as much knowledge and experience out of this education as you can, right? Take advantage of it, and don\u2019t forget to play outside and do what you love.",

He is bored and just waiting to be finished with jumping hoops. He only sees into his near future with discouraged eyes and not wanting anything to do with school for a long time. Upon approaching my younger self I see the shock in his eyes; he notices an older version of himself, downtrodden and beaten by uncaring workplaces and underappreciation. \"Don't give up on your education, Evan. It may seem silly now, but trust me, it gets a lot better. Take a year off from school to explore, then go back. Live without regrets and we'll be just fine.\" He is shocked and looks around to make sure he isn't crazy. \"Are you my ghost of distant future, or something?\" He asks his future self. \"You could say that. It shouldn't matter who I am, for all I offer is sound advice. Believe me, it seems boring now, but there is so much more to look forward to. Who can you trust if not yourself?\"",

I was able to go Spain, Italy, and France last year to learn about philosophy, art, and culture.  It was one of the most fullfilling experiences of my life.  Less than a dozen students per class creates the best learning environment, and the teachers actually want to help and teach their students.  Because of this school I was able to graduate early and have a year of college done at the same time.  APU has teachers that are better than anyone could possibly imagine.  My philosophy teacher has truly enlightened me; I really feel like I have a greater understanding of life because of him and a better ability to question everything.  Not only is the academic life superb, but the social life.  The residence life faculty has really fun events every day.  We can paint pottery, go skiing or snowshoeing, and go to concerts without having to pay.  The experience at APU could not be found at any other University, because of the activities done here and the variation of people that attend.",

Waiting on filling out sholarships did not really save me anything, in fact it partly hindered my school because of the time gap from senior year and when I start collage. If I had filled out sholarships my senior year, I could have had one year of collage done while what I learned in high school was still freash in my mind. Now I will have to review everything when I attened collage. \nI would also tell my self not be be afread of finding and filling out the scholarships, if I could go back and talk to myself.

You have limitless choices in life, so take advantage of your opportunities. Volunteer often, spend time with your family, dream about life.  Make life goals for yourself and then figure out how you're going to accomplish them. Nothing is impossible if you are determined enough.

That way when I do transfer into a 4 year university, all I have to do are the fun and more meaty classes. I believe this is where most of the knowledge will come from. Also, in the process, I'd make sure that I find a job within the field that I want to get into, such as Health Administration. It does not matter what type of job it is, I can be a file clerk or just an intern for the time being. With the changing economy, getting into this field is very difficult especially if you do not have any practical knowledge or experience in the field. Now a days, employers are seeking candidites with experience, and therefore, having that experience will help make my college career much easier. I will have the experience to discuss in classes and understand what it is when we are discussing issues in the field."

The  student body is small which has both positive and negative aspects. Thinking positive, it means smaller class sizes and easier for your professors to know you be name rather than a number. I prefer the small class size along with the large work load because I don't think I would be able to keep up with PharmD classes if I went to larger, more distracting school. The negative aspect of the small student body is that word gets around quick and its like being back in High School. As I stated before, the PharmD program comes with a large work load, especially during the P1 year. However, I am still able to have decent grades and a social life, but it takes alot of studying and hard work. "

While this seemed like a good idea at the time for post-graduatation job placement, it stressed the first half of my senior year. \n\nCollege is not about rank, its not about who does the most book learning; rather, it is a life experience that lets you be on your own and truly discover who you are as an individual. I did manage to get into some top-ranked schools, but I do not regret rejecting the offer of acceptance. I knew after visiting that ACPHS was the university that would let me grow into myself; there was no competition among my schools from which to choose.\n\nIf I could go back I would tell myself to apply to more schools which fit my personality and learning style and remove colleges to which I applied based solely on rank. College years are some of the greatest years pople have in there lives and its important that those years are spent doing what you love, not reminding yourself how \"great\" your school is according to polls and rankings.",

                "Ryan": "Given that my experience after high school involved transfering between two colleges, I would advise myself to apply directly to the second college, Albany College of Pharmacy.  While I did enjoy my time at the first college, the task of adapting to a new environment farther away from home seemed more frustrating after I learned that most of the credits I had earned by that point could not successfully be transferred.   After explaining to myself that using one school as a stepping stone to another simply makes matters more complicated than they need to be, I would also encourage myself to take more challenging classes even in my final year of high school to avoid becoming complacent.  As I have discovered recently, college courses such as Physics are considerably difficult without any prior background knowledge of the subject.  Such  simple advice would likely have spared me from the misfortune of obtaining a few less-than-ideal grades that could easily have been much better.",

Through all of this, do not lose yourself as a person, and lastly, give yourself a break when you most need it because you deserve it.\" These are the exact words I would tell myself as a high school senior. Since I could remember, school has always been a priority in my life, so much that I sometimes forget I need to give my mind and my body a break. I realize that when I struggle I cannot always beat myself up over it. As long as I try my best, that is what truly matters. Although I was never given this advice before starting college, I am content to have learned all of this throughout my college experience. I would take this advice and not only give it to high school me, but I would give it every other high school student as well.",

I'd tell myself that popularity gets you no where and that majority of the people I want to be friends with, are losers and mean. I would tell myself that family is everything and to not argue so much with my parents. Next, I would spend more time with my little sister. I definitely would have forced myself to cheer each year of highschool, and to never hang out with people who do drugs. I would make myself try 100% harder in school, because I probably could've been validictorian. I wish that I wouldn't have cared about other people, so I would make myself forget the people who hurt me.

As each year goes by, the workload becomes heavier and the stress starts to add up little by little. But all this is worth it in the end knowing that I will receive a PharmD degree upon graduation and that I will be able to reach for my goal to become a pharmacist at a women's and children's hospital.\nMy school prepares each student for the future, and it stresses the importance of our career. Even though the workload is excessive, the school tries to alleviate our stress by introducing us to a variety of outdoor activities such as skiing, snowboarding, and hikes. All this gave me a wonderful college experience, I learned that academics is important, but playing is also needed in life.

It has been valuable to attend college because as a proud 22 year old women I have a future. If I was not in the United States, I would have not gone to college. I would have been married by the age of 18 and would have been a good housewife. Now I am able to say that I have a career rather than just staying home and watching the children, cooking and cleaning.

Going to a new city and having to become friends with new people is a difficult task in itself.  In addition, living by myself for the first time also requires a bit of getting used to.  When that is coupled with the rigorous coursework it can be a lot for anyone to handle.  College teaches you how to manage all these aspects of your life.  Time management in my opinion is the most important skill anyone can gain; Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences stresses this fact.  By offering various seminars on effective time management strategies it makes the situation seem slightly less stressful.  What I've learned is that you have to be able to work hard but also enjoy yourself when time permits.  I feel as if I am more prepared for the real world after completing these two years of college.",

The nature of the school is what makes it so enjoyable.  Although the academic rigor often times causes stress and results in lots of time studying, it all pays off with a degree from this school because student alwyas can find a job post graduation.  This alone gives me the motivation to put in the work now, regardless of how hard and consuming it may be.  I know that when I graduate I will find and excellent job and I will be one hundred percent prepared for it.  My college experience has also been enhanced through my involvement.  I am part of the soccer team, I am a Student Ambassador, and I am also a peer mentor.  Involvement keeps me busy, but allows me to make new friend, blow off some steam from time to time, and msot importantly have fun.

A big skill I have picked up and will be focused on much more in the future is that of public speaking. Being a pharmacist requires much interaction and helping of other people so I have gained much people skills and vocal abilities in front of others while attending this school. All of the qualities from this school have their ups and downs but they are all mainly focused on provided the students with the best education and skills needed for the profession that the schools foundation is based on, and thats pharmacy.

But I believe my path can be far more global in scope.  In our increasingly integrated, globalized world, I believe my calling is global philanthropy, and I wish to serve the poorest sections of the world through organizations such as UNICEF or WHO.

Particularly, the classes in my major  were awesome. I think my time in college has been valuable to me for a couple of reasons. firstly, to help my time management skills, which, in my limited high school experience, did not exist at all.  I also learned a lot about my own personal character in my first few semesters of college. I learned that I am definitly in the right major, and that some professors are horrible at their job.

I love working with people and talking to them. The most exciting part about being a pharmacist is having the knowledge to know that the drugs being prescribed will help the patient live a better quality of life. I have also learned how to manage my time so I can get all of my work done and still have time for the clubs and activities I participate in, such as the outdoor club and the basketball team.

I\u2019ve learned to schedule out each day and write down everything that needs to be done. This has helped tremendously in staying caught up in each of my classes.\nBy managing my time efficiently, I am now able to study effectively. There is no more fooling around while trying to study, because I am on a schedule. I can always seek help from my friends when the workload seems impossible. They have different ways to study and I am always using their ideas to help make my study time more effective.\nTime management and effective study habits are crucial.

However, I wasn't one of those students who could balance the experience with the school work. Two years later I took a semester off to work. I went back and tried to buckle down and get good grades. My roomates however, were not students and I ended up leaving because I couldnt concentrate living where I did. After coming back home without a degree I knew I couldn't just not get one.

I have learned that in the right environment it is easy to admit when you don't know because you are there to learn and understand. I have learned that I will never know and remember everything but I will always have my friends and collegues to help me out. It is a difficult lesson to learn but being independent doesn't mean that you can never ask for help and is, in fact, a sign of maturity.\nCollege has been a valuable experience that I wouldn't pass up on; you learn not only about the classes you attend but about the bureaucracy that can get outright ridiculous. You learn to laugh at the next silly thing they decide is necessary because it is out of your control. You make friends for life as you study for hours for the next exam or run over to the student center to get a meal. You learn the importance of community in your residence hall and your campus.",

I have found that college is not just an \u201cinstitute of higher learning\u201d \u2014 rather, an experience. \n\nThe college experience is defined by once in a lifetime opportunities. Opportunities on the college campus range from sports and religious groups, to a unique social atmosphere, and recently discovered freedom. Truly, college offers something for everyone. \nThe skills and knowledge that a person acquires during a college education are beneficial in both the personal and professional worlds. Besides the personal experience that shapes the college students personality and perspective of life, college degree holder will earn significantly more money than the average high-school educated worker. Though a college is expensive, it pales in comparison to the cost of ignorance.  If you think the price of an education is expensive, try the price of ignorance.

I have to take care of myself for over half of the year. I am responsible for everything I do and there is no family here to help. I learned that I am responsible for my own actions. I have to keep a certain GPA to stay here and it is up to me to get myself to class and do my work. I also learned that it is ok to ask for help. I used to think I could do everything on my own. Once I started struggling my first year, I realized I needed tutoring. It was hard to get myself to go, but I am so glad I did. If I did not ask for help, I would not be at this school today.",
                "Sarah ": "One of the most valuable things I learned this year at college was time management. This is a skill which is very important in college as well as after college. College is the first real step when a child becomes an adult and having so much freedom can become overwhelming. There are so many things to do such as hanging out with friends, going to parties, sports that sometimes it\u2019s easy to lose track of school work. This is where time management comes into play. I learned that even though ACP may not be the easiest school to attend it is still possible to have fun and still get good grades if you manage your time wisely. \nAnother important thing that I learned at ACP was how to act as a professional. Soon after I began college I realized how my classmates and I were no longer treated as children. We had our own responsibilities and nobody was babysitting us anymore. I think this as well as the professional demeanor demanded by our teachers made us grow up fast. We soon learned how to be professionals without losing our own identity.",

Early within my college experience, I recognized the importance of obtaining an education that will help me improve my skills to excel in the workforce. I learned it was imperative to study the course material everyday and complete every assignment with much effort on time. Also, I learned to implement new study skills by reading the material, asking myself questions, joining study groups, and performing practice exams with good test-taking skills. Within my social life, I learned to make great friends with the same intentions I have in life. In addition, I learned to abstain from the negativities in life such as drug use, alcohol, and criminal activity. The most critical aspect I learned from college is to maintain my connection with my faith by attending service and reading the Holy Bible. \n          Ultimately, college has taught me principles academically, personally, and spiritually to excel in the field of pharmacy.

With this being my second attempt at college, my first attempt did't turn out so well, I have made the Dean's List or the President's List every single semester. I brought my GPA from a 1.82 to a 3.35 in two years. This is a huge accomplishment for a wife, mother, employee, and student. Third, I have been able to show my son that, no matter what happens, he can accomplish any and all goals that he will set for himsef as long as he is committed and he does his best.

I allowed myself to join clubs and attend events by myself, which is something I would never have done while in high school. The confidence I gained throughout my first year led me to apply for a job with residents life. I am now a resident assistant for incoming freshmen in order to help them with all the things I have faced.

College has taught me how to approach deal with and love people of different personalities, backgrounds, and morals. I have learned to move past physical features of a person and really learn about that persons struggles, life, wishes and dreams. Gaining these skills has turned me into a more caring, kinder and open minded person. It is very important as a soon to be health care professional to have acquired an attitude that is not judgemental, so I am able to help patients in need instead of having my health care advice be clouded by negative and narrow minded thoughts. Also, my new found attitude due to college experiences has given me a better self esteem, not being so self critical of myself like many girls my age. I have found peace, harmony and a healthy balance in my life.",

I have learned your grade is reflected by the amont of labor you place in preparation. I learned independence from my family always being around can be a blessing but there are sometimes with I need them. I learned the best friends in college are the ones who will stay up for 4 hours straight  and wake up at 6am just to study with you (this has happened) because you desperately need a good grade. I learned working together can help you succeed and to not be afraid to sound unintelligent. everybody has questions. College has been incredibly influencial to my life.

I know that school work comes first which is followed by basketball, but that is a choice that I have made because it is something I enjoy doing.  Albany College of Pharmacy is aware that there is a small chance that any athletes will become professional athletes, therefore they allow the chance for students to still participate in sports but have a larger focus on school and finishing their degree.  To me this is a valuable lesson, while growing up people typically want  to be someone famous and put school on the back burner but here we focus on getting a degree and becoming people that will better the community while at school and after graduation.",

Although it is unforunate that some students are unsuccesful, being able to help students is what I have found to be my way of reaching out to new and different people.  This has been a valuable experience to me through the gratification of being able to assist others in attaining there goals of being a pharmacy, and making their college experience a little bit easier and more enjoyable along the way.  Balancing this, along with my own academics has also been a valuable teaching tool, and I believe has better prepared for a demanding job world.",

There are things I now know I want to accomplish in my life that i can accredit to my time in college.  What I have experienced in college thus far has been extremely valuable in allowing me to complete my degree and let me eventually begin a very promising career helping those around me.  I would not change my college experience at Albany College of Pharmacy for anything.",

In high school I always managed to get good grades just by showing up and doing the minimal work. It is not like that in college. In college I have had to put in several hours of work a night and more so on the weekends. Because of this I have improved my time management, being able to put the work in I need to and still have fun with friends. The other thing I have taken is I now understand what it feels like to truly earn my grades. Specifically, I put more work into Organic Chemistry than any class before, and I was thrilled to see the results. All of these skills I have learned and harnessed are skills that will stay with me throughout life. I will continue to utilize them till the day I die, and that has to be the most valuable thing I have taken from attending Albany College of Pharmacy. These are skills that are specific to each student, and to be able to say I have found mine is a great accomplishment.",

ACPHS is a challenging school and that can be good and bad. Its good in the way that I am career focused and want to have a bright future as a Doctor of Pharmacy.  However, it can be bad in a way that sometimes I have absolutely no social life.  But I take it for what its worth, which is overall a good school. It will get me very far in life and sometimes you need that extra push and focus to teach you what's important.",

After much consideration, I determined that it would be in my best interest to attend my local state university taking classes that would  assist or enhance my future endeavors at Albany College of Pharmacy,. Having completed one year at SUNY Oswego will allow me to ease into my freshman year of Pharmacy School by taking fewer courses and  it has given me valuable exposure to collegiate level course work.  These are experiences that many other college freshmen don\u2019t have.  At first, I was only going to take a couple classes each semester but after talking to the SUNY Oswego Admissions Office I found that if I enrolled as a fulltime student I would be eligible for a Presidential Scholarship which would allow me to take five class for the total cost of taking two part time. classes. Thus, I was able to complete high school and 30 hours as a fulltime student at SUNY Oswego, I believe that this accomplishment was the best preparatory option before enrolling in Pharmacy school.",

Not only have I improved academically but also with the way I now view certain aspects of life. The experience has made me a more rational being that thinks thoroughly before acting.\nMy experience from college has made me to be more responsible and to realize that success can only be achieved by hard work.  For instance, at the ACPHS, nobody will ask you to attend lectures or to study your notes. That doesn\u2019t remove the fact that you are held accountable for the tests that come up. Where you happen to fail, you will be placed on probation and possibly released by the school. \nAt ACPHS, I was made to realize that respect for patient is highly important. Such respect could be in ways of keeping the patient\u2019s information confidential or providing adequate healthcare. That idea has made me to even have more respect for anybody around me. In our soccer team, I was made to realize how vital it is to stand by my teammates. That made me to look out for people around me.",
                "Christine ": "After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Biology  in 2009, I have since re-applied to pharmacy school and got accepted to ACPHS. While school is about academics, it teaches you a lot about your strengths as a person.  I have found that there is always going to be another student or professor that is going to make you feel insecure or inferior and it is up to you (the student) to not let that define you. College has taught me that for the first time, you are responsible for yourself and if you want something you have to go after it, it's not going to fall in your lap.  College has allowed me to find my own way and has given me the opportunity to figure out a career path that I may not have decided on without going to college. Attending college has given me carrer opportunitues, allowed me to make many professional connections that have gotten me accepted into pharmacy school. I honestly do not believe I would have successfully achieved this without all of these strengths I have obtained from my college experience.",

It took one acceptance from the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences to lay out the first stepping-stone to my personal redemption. \n\n       Since I have attended this college I've seen myself blossom into the student I knew I could be. I\u2019ve found meaning and personal value in my work. I can honestly say I've never studied this hard before in my past studies but I enjoy it. I love that my efforts have positive results towards my grades.  I am feeling  positive about my future and  my self-esteem. I achieve success by keeping up with my readings, asking the professors questions in office hours and working with my peers. I try everyday to discover new ways to improve the ways I learn. \n\nI have never been on the Dean\u2019s list before and now I can say I have for last semester and potentially this semester.

If there were more stores and restaurants that were accessible that would be good. Another improvement would be finding a place for transfer students to stay instead of putting them with the freshmen. I feel safe on campus and the food here is pretty good too. I would recommend someone to come here."

For freshman, there are special communities called living-learning communities where students are grouped with students of the same major. They live together, have similar classes, and an easy way to meet people with similar interest. Depending on your major, most professors have nothing less than a master's or doctorate's degree. They will always try to help you and encourage students to email them whenever they need help. Our extracurricular activities expand from cultural and interest clubs like, the Japanese Student Association and Astronomical Society to athletic clubs such as, Mixed Martial Arts and Rugby.There are always events going on whether its academical or recreational, there is something to please everyone's interest. There are always people to party with on the weekends, though you may find partying with your close friends to be a more humorous  event than going to a frat house downtown. Overall, UAlbany has the ability to give each student their own  wonderful college experience if the student is willing to seize the opportunity. "

At the right time, you will figure it out. Until then, stay focused and keep going. I know it's hard and that the work is overwhelming. It's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but you have to trust that it's there. Keep your eyes on the goal. You want to graduate high school and college and with a degree so that you can get a good job. Never lose sight of the goal. I know you want to give up and that you think you'll never make it through high school. Take it one day at a time, one assignment at a time.

Having some kind of plan, allows you to know exactly what you want to do and how to go about doing it. Also, I definitely did not understand how important a GPA is until I got in college but had I not known how important it was then, it would have helped me out tremendously. Having a high GPA, gives you an higher advantage to scholarships, money, and creates a stronger profile to colleges you may be interested in.",

Maintaining good grades can ensure that many scholarships will come your way. Although college life can be challenging at times, it can also bring personal fulfillment through other activities such as academic and social groups on campus to help develop and mold your character and independence as a person. Participating in these groups and organizations would allow you to show your dedication in volunteering for community service and allow others to see what kind of person you are.  After all, there is nothing like lending a helping hand to those who need it most. The last piece of advice and certainly not the least is to just be yourself. Being kind to everyone that you may come in contact with will take you a long way.

Just relax and understand that you have started a successful journey in your life.",

                "Kah'Nasha ": "Being in college has taught me a lot of responsibility and self control. I am glad I chose to go to college after high  school because many valuable lessons have been instilled in me. One of the most important lessons I have learned is to think before I act. This comes to me as very valuable because before I choose to do something I want to do, I have to realize what  I need to do is more important. I have also learned the value of money. If I am not focused and serious about important things, I will lose money. Since I come from a poor family,I cannot afford to lose money which is why I take school extremely serious. Out of my college experience, I have learned to be more sociable with others and more independent. I have also gained self discipline being that I do not live with my parents anymore.",
                "Marlana ": "Throughout college I learned many lessons, but the most valuable lesson that I learned there was that you get out what you put in.  There were plenty of students that just skated through the degree programs, never really putting a lot of work into them, and those are the students that are still looking for work.  On the other hand, the students that put in a lot of effort to succeed are now doing very well for themselves.  College was a wonderful experience, and while I do believe that it is not for everyone, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  It was an excellent transition into adulthood, where I am not completely on my own, but I have to learn discipline and self control.  There is no mommy there to wake you up for classes; you have to push yourself in college if you want to succeed.",

Nevertheless, through each struggle and hassle, I have become very adamant to continue my education no matter what hardships come my way.  College has vitally changed my life and it is something I definitely want to succeed at. It has been valuable to attend because when I look at the people back home, I see what my life could have been like if I did not attend college, and more importantly what I do not want my life to be like. Everyone dreams to be successful in life, but unfortunately everyone dreams are not met. I am given an opportunity to achieve my dreams and goals, and I am beyond determined to reach them. Overall, I do believe I can achieve success, and I believe my self- motivation, ambition, and courage will get me there.",

When I first came I was nervous that I wasn't going to have anyone to talk to but when I got there I could feel the love and embrace of the others because they felt the same as I felt. I can see now that we have have bonded and the bond that  I have with them and them with me; its something that can never be broken.  Albany State University is valuable to attend because unlike many colleges the professors will try and gt to know each and every student as if they were our parents or guardians and they want nothing but the best for the students. They take time out of their busy schedules to see that their lesson is being comprehended to a student.  When you feel comfortable asking questions and those questions get answered there is nothing that can turn you back from being successful.",

College presented opportunities that I never knew existed and presented the type of situations I never dealt with before, therefore, I rose above my challenges and even when I failed, I tried again and again till I succeeded. Albany State University encourages its students to excel in their studies while being involved with extracurricular activities. In return, students learn to balance and prioritize their lives. As students, we afforded several portals to advancing their careers through work-study, volunteerism, forums, workshops, and events hosted semester-round. Attending Albany State University has provided the assurance that after my matriculation and instilled desire of philanthropy, I will be a confident, persevering, and determined young woman ready to embark on my future endeavors as the future founder of my own abstinence awareness-mentoring program for the youth.",

If I could go back I would tell my self not to do that.  I would tell my self to take specific interest classes, classes that I wouldnt normally take.  I would do this so I could find out right away what I like and what I didnt like, and who knows I might have found out sooner my passion in life.

College is certainly a learning experience, and with open eyes a person can learn alot and progress into a better person.

I attended one year of college right after high school , but I didn't finish.  I was unsure of what I wanted to do.  That is such a tough decision for some 18 year olds, and understandably so.  Which, everyone has a story, and I certainly had my own reasons and circumstances as well.  Alot of the choices I made were contingent upon other things that I simply had no control over.  Even though its tough going back to school at my age, I am grateful for the opportunity and I try to focus on the positives instead of the regrets.",

There is so much that I did not know about before and the education helped me to find out who I really am and what I really want in my life. I would also tell myself that I should really think about what I want to do with my life, because I went to school for something I found out was not what I really wanted to do. I love art and music, but I also loved to draw so I went to school for that, but now I realize I should have just stuck with what I knew I wanted to do my whole life. Instead of letting my family and others tell me what I should do I would tell myself to follow my heart and no matter what do not let anyone tell me what I should do. Also college is an incredible way of meeting new friends and finding new things that I could love and enjoy doing for the rest of my life. It is a way for me to find myself and my destiny!",

Even though I had average study skills, I would advise myself to study harder than I did.  I would also advise myself to chose my friends more wisely when it came to my academic acheivements.  I also would love to tell myself to not go ahead on any of my assignments in class and to make sure it was all correct.   I would tell myself that life is not hard unless you make it and if you put your mind to it , you can do anything that you believe in as long as your heart is in it.  And last, but not least, I would advise myself to push my family to be more supportive  in my academics.

I felt like I missed out on a lot of things. Well I actually did. But now college life for me is so fulfilling. I would also tell myself not to get so involved that I couldn't keep up with my school work but just enough so I won't have to sit in my room all day and night. Also so I would tell myself to try new things. Stepping outside of my comfort box really helped me find who I was and what I wanted to be.

                "Miya ": "Choosing the right college is not always an easy decision. But there are some helpful tools to help you in narrowing down your choice. In  order to decide which college best suites your needs and wants, I would suggest paying each college you are interested in or considering a visit. This will allow you to choose whether you like the campus or not. I also can not stress enough how important it is to take advantage of any scholarship opportunity. Paying for college can be quite expensive and free money is always something to take advantage of. Last but not least I would suggest by saying make sure the college you choose is an excellent choice for your major.  Attending a school that does not focus on your major is not a wise decision.  Last words of advice are: to enjoy your college years and do your best to excell with flying colors. There is going to be plenty of times you don't want to go to class but just keep reminding yourself of the bigger goal that you are trying to achieve.",
                "Janeka ": "Wow! I would have so much to say to myself! First and foremost I would tell myself to apply for scholarships. I assumed that my volleyball scholarship would be huge. My assumption was inaccurate. I have never won any scholarships which is why this one means something to me.  Another statement that I would tell my high school half is to apply for more schools. I only researched four colleges and now that I have had the opportunity to view other schools, I wish that I would have searched longer.  The final words of advice that I would give my younger persona is do NOT attend Albany State University. I love the college life and my classes that are vigorous. However, for some strange reason, I am not comfortable here. I believe that my knowledge could have been expanded somewhere else. But as I stated before, I won't leave. I will stay because, I love my volleyball team and my coach. Coach Skinner is like another father figure to me. I am proud to be a volleyball player for the Albany State University Lady Rams and I will pour my heart out next season with God by my side.",
                "Devorah ": "If I could go back in time, for starters, I would tell my high school self to pick the school that would best suit my interests. I would not go to a school simply because my friends went there, or because it was the only one I thought I could get into. Secondly, I would tell myself to investigate the city, the campus itself, make sure I visit, is it somewhere I could see myself being comfortable for however many amount of years I plan to spend there.\nI would most definately get myself prepared for the work load and the change of pace in college. Where as in high school we have our parents to make us do work, and teachers check homework, and test us on the reading we were supposed to do, college is a lot more vigorous. When your instructed to read, they dont go over it in class, you simply have tests. There are not make up days, extra credit assignments, you just do the work. \nIf I could go back to myself as a senior and just give a little bit of advice, I would have been better prepared for college.",
                "Amanda ": "Knowing what I know now from the college experience and just life experience in general would be to appreciate the small things that we tend to take advantage of as high school seniors.  We take advantage of so many things, big and small.  I know that I never worried about a job, or paying bills, or watching what I spent my money on but when you get out in the real world and you atart making our own money there are so many things to worry about.  Starting with a job, then paying for bills and groceries, and of course college actually is a lot more difficult than high school ever thought about being.  However, I suppose the biggest advice would be to myself would be to value time with family.  Family and having people around you have such a huge impact on your success in college and in life.",
                "Chavon ": "If i could go back as a high school senior the best advice I would say is to take my time and breath through difficult situations. I found myself in a whole new world on my first day of college, which really made me cry. I felt as if i was a small fish and a huge ocean! I would also say to learn how to manage my time better. This is because I have learned that when you get behind in your work than it is exremely difficult to catch up, and life is much more easier when you stay on top of your game.",
                "Camille ": "I would tell myself to try harder that way my GPA would be a 3.0 and I would be elgible for HOPE. I also will tell myself to practice more on my instrument that way I could get a higher scholarship than I already have.",

                "Jasmine ": "If I was a high school senior again, i would take the tool of time management skills and constantly enforce it in my life. I've learned that time management is the most important tool to get through college, its advantages and disadvantages. Working with mant peers and staying activiely involved in student organizations, its key to have time management in order to maintain the work load. By having time management, I've learned to prioritized and know that certain things will work in my life and some things won't. Going into my second year in undergrade, the work is not getting easier so its important to take on wht you can and can't handle, in order to strive for future school endeavors.",

It is also important to talk to your advisor to plan out your classes. if you are going to need fincial aid try to get work study or if your shcedule allows it get a part time job in order to pay back student loans a s soon as possible to eliminate furture debt.

A school that is an actual learning institution for students financially stable and others who are trying to get there such as yourself. Looking into your past and the situations you have been in makes you want something greater. Find a school that will help you do great and better things. A school that will give you knowledge that no one can take away and you can provide to others whom (like you) did not get a real chance at school because of your financial situation. Right now, your thinking what i am saying is stupid and riduculous.

Stay in the city for a weekend to try and gasp the vibe of the city to make sure you're able to focus. Also, don't get sucked up into the hype of your freshman year; remember that you're hear to get an education, so maintain a healthy workload and NEVER procrastinate. Learn to balance your social life with your work so you can gain your education and a slight look into the real world.",
                "Erica ": "Choosing the right college for a student really narrows down to the personality of the potential student. Yes, some parents or most moms', would rather their child attend school close to home; meanwhile the young adult thinks otherwise.  However these are some things a student and/or parent should factor in.  One thing would be, knowing the enviornment that he/she can handle. If a student prefers a small campus,they should look at colleges that aren't so immeasureable in size including class size, such as Ohio State. One might even consider location. Students who like the rush and the lavish community but can also handle the school work load would probably want a college in/ near the city and vice verse. Once  enviornment/ location are considered, the student should look and see if the college(s) offers all the classes needed for them to complete their major(s)/ undergrad. Now to the student/social life!  A student should acknowledge their future, when it comes to building their resume.  Student activites such as:  Basketball, Tennis, Track or organization such as: Student Government, Community Service Projects and Greek Life are key to building one.  So choose responsibly and Good Luck!",
                "Tammey ": "Be open to new experiences. Research the schools you are interested in go for a campus visitation and see if its the enviroment that you could see yourself in everyday.

                "A'sha ": "My advice to parents and students about finding the right college and making the most of the college experience is to first do as many campus visitations possible. Make a list of the colleges you are interested in and set up appointments for you to visit. Also, when you are there, don't only visit the school. Travel around that community and learn more about their economic environment and community involvment. The second thing is to stay on top of financial aid and to apply to as many scholarships available. The third thing that will be beneficial is to always have an open mind in all aspects of your life as well as your college or university.  This means to eagerly try new things, to be involved on and off campus, to always be mindful of the other people surrounding you, and to love the school you attend. And finally, I would tell the student to not be afraid of asking for help in tutoring to help them along the way in their academic endeavors.",

Going to school is about furthering your education and bulilding a net work for the future, and there are a lot of people who go for the wrong reasons.  College has helped me become a better person and it also has helped me grow inside and out. The faculty at my school always says, \"If you come to ASU as one person, and graduate as another, we have done our job and so have you\". I feel like right now I am becoming  a better/another person, more mature, intellectual, and willing to volunteer at any time.  I know when I gradute I will be so much closer to my goals. Choose a school that will also help you do the same, do not settle for anything less than what you deserve.",
                "Keisha ": "I would tell parents and students to visit the university on days other than campus visitation days.  This gives you the best look outside the show they may try and put on.  Also, you may be able to sit in some classes and see how the professors are, the class size, and classroom facilities. Ask the students what they think about the school.  Talk to students in your intended major. They will not sugar-coat what its like and what it takes to be dedicated.  Spending time at the university can also give you an insight on the campus life, beyond the tables that you see at campus visitation. Don't have your heart set on just one school. Visit and ask questions to aid in your decision.",

If they live in a small town or city then a larger school would probably not be best.  However, the student may like getting out into the big city world in order to spread their wings. Making the most of the college experience is merely based on having fun. No student should be stressed out all of the time about their classes and school work. On the other hand, students should not forget about their work and just have fun. There is a time for work and play and everyone knows that students should work first and play later. Students should make friends and relax and take things one day at a time.",

However, other individuals forget to enjoy the last year of their high school and starts to stress over every little thing. In my senior year, I didn't go to any trips and even to my prom night. It was all because I was actually stressed out with my school work and most of all, I was failing my math class. Then, I decided to do my best and stop stressing because stressing get you nowhere. After learning a lesson from myself, I joined after school activities so that I can get my mind of stuff. I joined a CPR class and to be honest, I've never had so much fun in any other class.

The consequences of  your study habits will no longer be determined by your parents or teachers but rather an understanding of the direct effect that they will have on you. Study before the party; your brain is much more capable of focus without a hangover.

In order to succeed in the college lifestyle and post college life, you need to be confident in yourself and know where you stand on important issues. You need to follow what you love, no matter what any friend, parent or advisor tells you. The people who are most successful, end up this way because they took the initiative to realize what they wanted and applied it to their education. You can't go into a college hoping you'll 'figure it out along the way', you need to know exactly what you want out of yourself, your education and your community and go after it.

It appeared to me that if you were not well to do and fit a certain type of person, you wouldn't have much luck with other students. I am a very shy person who can come off as awkward and have put myself out there in one semester more than I have in four years of high school and have yet to connect with one student. On the positive side, the class sizes were relatively small and the campus was a lot less overwhelming to me than if I went to a public university. The teachers seemed to care about their students, which you don't see everywhere. Also, I was going to take a leave of absence to focus on my personal well being but I did not qualify so I was forced to withdraw completely, which wasn't very helpful. So, if you don't think you'll have any trouble fitting in with the social norm and can handle living somewhere where there isn't much to do off campus you might have better success than I have at this college.

It is a small, cozy feeling campus and I felt it I was right where I wanted to be. Because of the size, everyone knows everyone and its easy to find groups to hang with. We have a variety of clubs on campus and if there is not one that fits for you , you can make one.  Granted it is not perfect and we are working on being better with diversity, but the school recognizes that and there is improvements being made. "

With the small class sizes, good student to professor connections, and an active Greek and athletic presence within the campus, there is no reason why Albion shouldn't be thriving. However, I am seeing that there seems to be mistakes made within the leadership at Albion as they take everything too seriously. I know it may sound funny to say that, but it's true, everything and everybody in management is too up tight about being perfect that they lose sight of what college is really supposed to be. Yes, we are supposed to be learning and becoming prepared for the real world, however, this is also the last time we will really ever get to be kids and they don't really allow for fun and mistakes to coincide. For some of Greek life it seems if they mess up slightly then they are kicked off campus, or if students try and take a stand against the college for issues that needs to be fixed, the college just overlooks. Not only do they over look students, they over look those who are not of liberal or conservative belief. Any republicans that are students have absolutely zero say in anything, especially if they are in Greek life. It seems the college is out to get the leading source of income (outside of donors) that it has. Recently one of the fraternities was kicked off for an accident on miscommunication between all parties involved, and the affected person was not harmed in the process, but, the college saw it as a way to get rid of them seeing as they don't like Greek members anyways. I give the college a 3-Star because I expect so much better from an establishment such as this and hope that future generations of this amazing institution don't have to suffer like I, as well as countless others have. I hope for the best for Albion and hope I can be successful enough in the future to give back to the campus that has given me so much. "

There's really not much to do in town, but to busy the students, the school puts  on fun activities for us, and the community, to partake in, so they won't make bad choices. The student body tries to come together to help other students feel comforted, and happy, if sad. Though, Albion College has a few  flaws, it's a home away from home for me."

They are always willing to help students out and make sure they understand class room material. It's a small college with lots of opportunity to figure yourself out in a safe environment where people are willing to help and understand you. I think Albion college needs time and patience to evolve with the already evolving student body. "

The food is not always fresh, there isn't always parking space and my showers aren't always hot. But the little detailed of Albion were not the most important in influencing my experience over this last year. I made connections with peers who have changed the way I love and socialize. I made connections with professors that have changed my outlook on life and others. And I have made connections with people I don't even know simply because we go to the same school. The community tie of those who attend or have attended Albion is unlike anything I've experienced. Of course, Albion has its flaws, any school will, but I would take overly salted vegetables and no parking spaces any day because Albion is the perfect school for me."

However if you proceed to go and find something to do you get a great discount. The professors care about their students and always have their doors open for questions. Sports and clubs mean alot to Albion. The facility want to see student meeting new people and finding common interests.  That is why I love Albion."

With class sizes being so small, all of my professors know who I am, as well as how I am doing in their class. Which makes it easy to have a great relationship with my professor so if I need help they are more than welcome to help me. Outside of the classroom the overall atmosphere of the school is great as well. Everywhere you go you can always find someone you know, since it is such a small school everyone knows everyone. The staff around the college are also very welcoming and make the experience that much better! Since I am a student athlete I will say that our sports facilities are great as well, we have the best fields in almost every sport in our league! As well as having great fields we have greats coaches in all sports, each coach makes sure we put school above anything else making it easy for us to balance both school and our sport. There are also areas for all students not just athletes to come and play any sport they wish. Overall Albion is a fantastic school where I am receiving a great education!"

This means that the class sizes are smaller, and you will usually have the same students in many of your classes if you both have the same major. You get a lot of direct attention from your teachers, and they actually will notice if you are late. The greek life on campus is fantastic and highly inclusive. It is made up of over half of the campus, and greek life has a higher average GPA than the regular students on campus. It is a residential campus, so it is near impossible to live off-campus, which is extremely annoying if you want to get off of the meal plan. "

That's basically the only reason I stay here. The housing is absolutely terrible. There are very limited options while on campus and you CAN'T even live off campus. Not that anyone would want to live off campus because the city of Albion is so run down and frankly dangerous. They shove us all into these little dorms and crappy on-campus apartments while raking in more and more students each year. They want bigger enrollment but wont spend the money to accommodate the students.  I was thinking about buying a house, fixing it up and to live there and rent it out to other students who don't want to live in the jail-like dorms but Albion College literally FORBID me and my family from doing it. Albion College is so expensive and the only reason I could think of why they wont let you live off campus is because THEY'LL LOSE MONEY from paying for the dorms/apartments on campus.  That's another thing, the financial aid office is so hard to work with to get your tuition down.  Albion College had a 176.6 million dollar endowment last year in 2017, I have yet to see anything done with this money....oh yeah they built a walk way with a \"nice\" wall near the honors building and a new locker room for the volleyball team who \"finally\" made it to the tournament and where every recruit on the team quits because they are treated so bad. Where is my money going??????"

It is your job now, not your roommate, your professor\u2019s, or your parent\u2019s job to keep you true to your work and your grades.

Be the bigger person when you can and don\u2019t boast about it.  It\u2019s better than holding grudges, being in fights, and staying unhappy.

Based upon things such as price, location, offered majors etc.  After settling on what colleges i would apply to i would definitely have taken the time to find as much financial aid as possible whether it be via FAFSA or scholarships such as this one.  I knew from the begining money is not easy to come by, therefore i made the decision to attend a community college over a 4 year not due to grades but cost.

I would definitely tell myself that college is nothing like high school.  In college, the homework is different, you have to be organized, manage your time correctly, and be thorough in everything that you do.  There is no giving half of your effort and getting a good grade, and there is no missing an assignment because you \"left it at home\" and being able to turn it in the next day.  You have to be fully and completely focused in what you are doing, whether it is reading, doing a math problem, writing a paper, or studying for an exam; You cannot be focused fifty percent.

Make sure to read, because there is a reason your preofessors are assigning it. It might be boring and tideous now, but in next semester's classes and even years down the road, or even in a conversation you'll be having next week, it will be relevent. And lastly, not to stress out too much. It falls into place most of the time. And if it doesn't, then it wasn't meant to be that way.

Would I be one of those individuals? Even though I received good grades in high school, college would be completely different. However, my grades turned out very well; I received a 3.85 first semester. I spent so much time worrying about whether or not I would do okay in college and as it turns out, I did fine. \nI also spent a fair share of time being anxious about not finding friends: I am going to a college where I did not know anyone before coming. I was so nervous that with all the free time college is supposed to contain, I would not have anything to do.

That is partly the reason I have chosen to stick with education as my major. I have experienced many hardships throughout my life but have still been able to attend college in hopes of reaching my goals in the end.  College is so valuable to me because I believe it opens many doors for me and provides me with the chance at a healthy and  exciting future. Accomplishing your goals is much easier through college and the possibilities are endless.

Learning this was pivotal in my personal life.\n\nBeing a major in Anthropolgy and Sociology taught me that not every study truly shows what it sets out to explain and not every legislative policy really reaches the ends it is purported to do so.  This background has also taught me that creative policies created by the people who the policies will apply to are usually the most successful in reaching the goals of the policy.  I have taken this policy and used it to my benefit in my legal studies by questioning the rules and stautes I apply daily.

I am opening my world to so many different opportunities that I would have never dreamed of before.  After being with the same people all throughout high school, college is like starting over.  There's more people to meet and more friends to make.  Although I knew it was going to be difficult and I was going to be busy all the time, receiving a good grade, or winning a basketball game, or being accpeted for a job are still just as rewarding as I can remember, if not more.

Having a lot on my plate has really made me buckle down and schedule out my priorities. My favorite part of college is being able to join so many groups that appeal to my interests. By joining Union Board, I have made so many friends while providing fun entertainment for my school and community. Also by joining Intervarsity Christian, I am able to confide in my peers about religious matters that I may not be able to handle on my own. My favorite part outside of school is the experience of living on my own.

Second, I would advise myself to make a list of the things that are most important to me, and to do ample research to eliminate as many colleges as possible without visiting them. There is no need to visit a college that does not have the major I am interested in, for example. Thirdly, after choosing which college to attend, I would encourage myself to bring numerous pictures from home of my family and friends, which would give me a sense of comfort in my new home. Last but not least, knowing that I am a shy person, I would tell myself to open up to people and be friendly- not be afraid to talk to people and to make friends.

While in college take time to find yourself and stay true to your beliefs.  Your education is important, but you do not have to prefect to get a job.

Also I would tell myself not to panic about going in and now knowning anyone because you are going to meet new people and make new friends and it will not be as hard as you think.

In college you are in competition with yourself, because you hold the power to make yourself stronger or break yourself down. When you move into the dorms and start to attend class, don't play and work later, instead you need to change your  high school tyoe mindset and become a worker first and a player second. College is a whole different experience that you haven't had yet and because of that you need to take this bull by the horns as soon as you walk into the arena.

Talking and participating is much more fun and makes you a much more enjoyable and friendly person to be around. Everyone is in the same boat as you and is just as nervous about the transition as you are. Not to mention, although your education is the same place as your social life, you should make the decision to set aside time for each one so that you do not los focus with your academics ad you ill still have time for other activities.

Be sure to stand up for yourself.  It?s hard, but standing up for yourself will make others respect you and will also help you gain the confidence you need.  Study hard, but remember that grades truly are not everything.  That?s a hard lesson to learn, especially for someone who was very academically focused in high school, but if you only focus on doing well in your classes, you?ll miss out on so many valuable opportunities to make friends and socialize.  That doesn?t mean you have to attend the frat parties and become a party girl, but make sure that you set time aside to just to have fun.  Become involved in campus activities.

Along with parents and friends, in college there is a whole department that is there specifically to help with determining what a student's strengths and weaknesses are and what they can do with these talents. There are departments to help with the transition between living at home and college life. What I didn't know in high school was that EVERYONE is going through the same experience and no one expects you to pick up this new life in a day. Going to college does not mean leaving behind your life at home; it only means finding a way to merge the old and new aspects of your life together into the life you were meant to lead.",

Becoming a more active college student would have made my time at school much more rewarding and less one-note. I would also tell myself to be more enthusiastic and active about my plans for the future, instead of living for just today. That would allow for me to prepare myself better for the next step and not have to spend so many years in transition between the different steps. Procrastination is another factor that I could have done without, and I would make sure to tell myself all the negative effects that come with procrastination.

My college requires students to have a high skill set of writing.  Practicing your writing skills is very important to become a fluent writing.  Being focused on school is the main key.

Don't get too caught up in your studies to realize that college is a great time to expand your social life, experience new things, and have fun with some really cool people.

Everyone involved in the college decision must realize that the next four years will be a life changing experience and regardless how sure an individual believes they wish to study or pursue as a career, it is likely to change.  An institution of education should not, therefore, be selected for the specific programs it offers but the extent to which its programs are diverse and interdisciplinary.  Liberal Arts schools or schools with an emphasis on general education tend to fit this criteria well and allow a student to make new decisions based on the new information they learn in college without having to delay graduation.\nIt is a wise idea to approach an undergraduate institution the way you would a graduate school: the most important part is not where you study, but who you study with.  During a college search students should make an effort to meet and build relationships with proffessors.

Be sure to ask a lot of questions, know what you're looking for, or ask questions to figure out what you're looking for. Each student is different, so you can't rely on other students' opinions 100%. Input from others helps, but in the end, you have to determine what you want in a school. As far as making the most of your college experience, go to a lot of social events at first. Even if you're a shy person, it's good to get out, even to join a lot of groups on campus. Experiment with different groups and see what fits you best.

This is a great way to meet people you wouldn?t normally meet. Our campus organizations span from volunteer organizations like Habitat for Humanity to religious groups like Catholic Connections.

Classrooms and the physical facilities are acceptable, and the course work is fairly hard, but it pushes students to really think.  The Albright community is a family and is very diverse. "

There is a healthy blend of races and backgrounds and there is very little racism present on campus which is refreshing. There are a lot of parties but they are also very easy to avoid. The library serves its purpose but isn't great. Dorms are very small and communal bathrooms aren't the worst regarding cleanliness and functionality. Safety is very satisfactory however, the health center is not a good place to go if you need help or have questions simply because they treat students like  ignorant children. Overall it is a very nice environment if you are looking for a small friendly school."

The only issues I have are the food in the caf\u00e9 and that you need  a car to go to most places besides weis, CVS and wawa. If you want to go shopping or get something to eat you have to travel but not too far."

The party and social scene is below average, but it's not hard to have a fun weekend with a couple of friends. Academically speaking, the teachers know your name and the class sizes make it very easy to pay attention to the material."

                "Comment": "i chose this school because i liked the curriculum. they did a good job at selling themselves. Beautiful outdoor campus,. foodplaces are decent, resources the library offers is great, everything else is a different story.\n\n--First time returning a book in the library, a few weeks into my first semester as a freshman, one of the student workers at the desk, some guy with red hair and beard, was rude and passive, making a sarcastic remark after I innocently asked \"can I return my book?\". He whispers to his co-worker, \"No, you can't, you have to keep the book and pay the fines.\" Yes, I even remember exactly what was said. Perhaps he thought I did not hear him but after I went back to my table in the library I was literally crying to my roommate out of anger and DISGUST, that the school could hire someone so immature to deal with people. I don't care if they were having a bad day or something. Terribly unprofessional. It would be different if it were a humorous joke to my face but it was a snide remark as I was walking away. There is no excuse to be so rude about an innocent, naive, freshman customer AND peer, who actually bothered to use the library.\n\n--The whole viral \"blackface\" video incident. That is terrifying, and constantly leaves me wondering just who else in the school around me can be hiding this kind of personality and lack of moral values.. NEVER FORGET. Even if it was a \"joke.\"\nOne day while walking to my class, a couple of boys were walking a distance behind me. We cross paths with an elderly man, guiding a young boy and teaching him how to use his senses to navigate. The child was blind. After we pass, the couple of \"bros\" behind me start joking-- \"He looked like a creep. He's probably a rapist. But only for little blind boys.\" WHAT. THE. F***. If this is the below-average student at Albright, that's sad. Depressing, really. I wish I turned around and told them to shut the **** up. Knowing there's people like this in the world disguised as normal humans disenlightens me so much. It almost makes me wish I wasn't part of this world, /let alone/ this school.\n\n--First year seminar: literally teaching you how to write, create slideshows, discuss, and do basic things as though students didn't spend 12 years of their life learning how to get through school let alone make it into college. REQUIRED course. Money sucker. It's tolerable if you get into the subject of your first choice, but literally everyone in my class also did not have it as their first choice. More than half the class dropped the course within the first month. Sad.\n\n--ONLY fashion majors can use colored printing. Not art majors, not digital media majors. And the school prides itself on how it emphasizes the importance of the arts... Which is what sold me into going here. Lie. Even the student workers in the arts gallery desk seem so dis-enlightened. No \"hello, enjoy your stay,\" \"goodbye/have a good day/thank you for visiting\" like every other workplace. And that is their one job. They will answer if you have a question though, so grateful for that.\n\n--Shoved in the basement for student housing. I wouldn't complain if the floor planning and facilities weren't so utterly terrible. There have also been multiple times where I'd wait an hour just for the R.A. on duty to actually be in the building when i needed them. \n\n--Surrounding city is practically dead. The nearest  center has multiple es shut down. It surprises me that the school is still doing well. They seem to have a lot of money, considering the tuition price per student. You have to wonder where that money is going though because it definitely does not seem to go to bettering school's facilities & resources, nor background checks.\n\n--HUGE DEAD COCKROACH FOUND IN MY DORM ROOM TODAY. Regularly vacuum, replace trash, and had No food in my dorm for weeks, and it appears. In the corner. Dead. Did not even know there were cockroaches. Had encounters with centipedes though.\n\n\n\nIf you want to dorm, don't do it here. Wish I moved before it was too late into the year. Definitely not the ideal college freshman experience."

I was very nervous to move from home, but once I was greeted by the friendly students all my fears disappeared.  I appreciate how Albright has the friendliest staff and professors working their.  They all want us to succeed and accomplish our dreams.  All of my professors have an open door policy, and they stay late to help their students who are having a little trouble in class.

I wish I could tell her that it was going to be okay, and that one day, she would be the kind of person she wished she knew when she needed help the most. I wish she knew that one day, she was going to work with other young women, who had similarly difficult girlhoods, in college. I wish she had the hope for a better future that I have now that I am older.",
                "Kimberly ": "Through my experience at Albright I have gained confidence and understanding.  I attended Albright's Bethlehem Campus and graduated from Albright's accelerated degree program with my BA in Applied Psychology and Organizational Behavior.  I spent two years with an amazing cohort and I would not trade this educational experience for another.  I was the youngest member of my adult cohort which consisted of all women, strong women.  From this experience I gained a few mothers and big sisters.  We encouraged and pushed eachother to succeed, and every member of our cohort graduated together, proud of our accomplishments.  Many of us were working full-time and had families to take care of, but that did not stop us from putting together endless group projects and research papers.  In my two years at Albright I learned a great deal about myself and about the human mind,  behavior, and interaction.  I feel that I better understand the world of psychology, the ethics involved, the challenges and rewards, the endless research, and the wonder and joy of discovering the intricate workings of human nature.  I believe my time at Albright was well spent, I feel I have gained a family and an education.",

Thus far, I have attended Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, KS.  Needless to say, the transfer from high school to college was a blast.  I have met plenty of wonderful students and teachers and have established multiple friendships.  On top of that, the education I have received is phenomenal.   I am now ready for a university experience but need a few extra bucks to attend.  I intend to lock down my future in a business major and some day take control of my life by taking control of a major organization.  Business management is the way to go.  I cannot even begin to stress enough how important a degree is for me.",
                "Sierra ": "The last year has been an incredible ride for me. I have undergone many good changes since I graduated high school and I have Albright College to thank for that. During my freshman year at Albright, not only did I live in a dorm and attend classes but I have made lifelong friends and blossomed into a person I never thought I would become. Most of all, Albright has given me the opportunity to attend and become an official Albrightian. In my opinion, this is the most rewarding thing because I have been giving a chance to make a difference and work with some of the most amazing people that I have ever met. I have been given the opportunity to succeed and reach for the stars.",
                "rosemarie ": "There are many factors that have affected my life, college being one of them.  There are many reasons why obtaining a college degree has such a strong influence on my life. A college education can open doors to a better, brighter future for myself.  People that have attained a college degree are hired in at a higher pay and are considered to be much more employable.    My grandfather served in wwII and lived through the Great Depression.  I want to be able to make his efforts count by obtaining an education.  I think a college graduate would be more likely to be offered employment than another who did not attend college or did not attain a degree.   My college experience so far has been enjoyable, and I have grown from it.  The expense, however, his a large burden on my parents, and now on myself as well.",
                "Stephanie ": "I would tell a high school senior to look at the availability of financial aid because you do not want to be in debt when you graduate.  Also, look at how career-focused a college/university is because that will help you with your future and I would encourage them to get an internship for experience.  Make sure you like the size of the school and classes and get the attention you need from professors because they are there to guide you and you do not want to feel like you are just a number in the system.",
                "Peter ": "I would tell myself not to stress over the transition so much. College is very similar to high school in terms of the work load. Making friends in college is not very hard and the people are all working toward graduation, so they are all motivated.  Instead of worrying about how difficult new classes will be, get excited about the opportunity to learn things which interest you.  You and your friends will not grow apart--the internet will keep you togther. Although you do not want to call your parents all the time, make sure that you keep in touch with them. They will take it personally if you do not make time for them at least once in a while. Remember to call your grandparents and aunts, too. Keep your head up and you will adjust to dorm life very easily. Stay positive and think of college as a new beginning instead of an ending.",
                "Country ": "The main thing that I would tell myself is that I need to find an education that  works for me, not one that is just there to earn me money. Thinking back I have no idea as to why I wanted to become a doctor when I hate science, so I would have tried and talked myself out of going for the money and into finding something that I enjoying doing.  I would talk bout how important it is to want an education in something that is for you and not because someone or something says otherwise. Also I would have tried to get myself into a better study habit as the one I have now does not seem to be working for me.   But the main thing  that I would tell myself  is that you have to be true to yourself and do what makes yourself happy not others.",
                "Kiara ": "If I could go back in time and give myself advice first I would say: do not procrastinate, try to stay focused because college is a lot faster paced. No one is there to hold your hand so you have to be responsible for yourself. I would also advise myself to be open minded. There are a lot of different types of people at college ,unlike high school everyone isn?t similar. Being open to different opinions and ways of life can only make you a better person.",
                "Allison ": "Looking back at my high school years, I think how simple and somewhat effortless it seemed.  The classes did not move at a rapid pace, more of a calm routine.  Now being a college student, I am learning just how many hours are needed to fully succeed as a Biology major, or any major for that matter.  The tests and projects in high school did not seem to require a lot of energy, whereas, the tests in college can be on any small area of what has been covered in class at any point.  This may seem like an obvious answer to this question because obviously he workload is increased; however, I did not truly believe that it would actually be that different.  The truth is college is extremely effecting your future and what your potential job will be in life.  I went into college with the same attitude as high school, where I did not think studying was as necessary as it truly is to succeed.",
                "Mariena ": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior and give myself advice about college I would say, study, study, study. I would tell myself to make sure I study everyday or at least 2-3 times a week. In college you only have a couple of tests a semester, so you need to do well on every test if you want that A. Make sure you know everything they tell you to study because it will be on the test, they aren?t kidding when they say, ?Know everything in the notes.? I would also tell myself to sit close to the front. This allows you to see better and allows you to concentrate easier on what you are being taught. Also, always ask questions if you aren?t sure, even if it sounds like a dumb question. The teachers will answer you, there is no such thing as a stupid question. One last thing I would tell myself is, always go to the review sessions, even if you know what to study or don?t have questions, still go. It will help you out more than you think it will.",

                "Deanne ": "I would tell my high school senior self to not wish high school away and enjoy it while it lasts. Don't be so quick to want to cut ties to so many people because you may not find many friends right away in college. Despite feeling like you don't fit in, keep talking to people and sooner or later you'll find people you enjoy being around.",
                "Michelle": "If I was able to go back in time and give advice to myself as a high school senior, I would assure myself that no matter what, things would work themselves out. There are many roads stretched before you as a high school senior; it can be overwhelming at times. The most important thing is to never lose yourself through it all, remain true to yourself and keep your sights set on whatever it is that motivates you. Stay calm when times are rough and don't allow stress to hinder your judgment. The future lives within you and no one can change that. The future is what you make of it and great things lie ahead no matter what path you take. Above all, remember who you are, what you stand for, and the values you hold close. If you can do this, everything else will just fall into place, piece by wonderful piece.",
                "Anna ": "The advice I would give myself is to not be afraid to befriend new people. I would suggest to join more clubs and get more involved on campus. College is a place to find out who you are. You cannot be afraid to be who you are because if you do not accept youself, then you cannot expect others to accept you either. Fellow freshmen are in the same position you and the upper classmen were once in your position as well, so you cannot be scared to talk to others and express your thoughts and feelings.",
                "Rebecca ": "I would tell myself to take more time and research schools.  Think of what kind of college experience I truly want and only apply/consider those schools.  Realize the greatest memories come from undergrad so make sure I choose a school that will give me the kind of memories I want.",
                "Julian ": "For finding the right college, I would recommend that students actually take a good look at the school they're applying to. Visit the campus. Take a tour. Talk with some of the students there. If you're going to be interviewed by someone in the school administration, financial aid, maybe, prepare for the interview beforehand so you're able to give clear, well thought out answers (yes, even if you're great at improvising). Look through the application. See what the social life on campus is like. Are there many opportunities to study abroad? Basically, know the school inside and out before you start attending.\n\nOnce you're at college, and especially if you're attending a liberal-arts college (as it's one of the graduation requirements), take a few courses that aren't required for your major...that are in a completely different field FROM your major, in fact. Who knows, you might be surprised.",
                "Hilary ": "If I was able to go back in time to my senior year in highschool to give myself advice to transitioning to college, I would tell myself that I need to remember to relax.  During my senior year I started getting extremely intense about my studying and grades, and dropped a lot of the social aspect out of my life.  This was in preparation for what I thought I would have to do in college.  So this trend continued in college and I have not yet let myself go out and just have fun.  Every minute of every day is scheduled to include maximum studying time.  The best advice I could go back and give myself is to remember to always have fun and to balance that with school, and not to let school take over my life.",
                "Jacara ": "My first piece of advice would definitely be to weigh the options and all factors that are involved with college. Many eople assume that college is just about the academics. But, class size, the size of the campus, extra-curricular activities, meal plans, housing, meal plans, and financial aid (if necessary) are just a few things that need to be added into the equation. I think being comfortable at the school is important too; being at a school where a student can not have fun, and unwind after all the stress rom academics is, put simply, not fun. Not having any outlets can make the student just as stressed, sometimes even more, than the actual academics.  Its important to understand that this decision is one of the most important decisions that a student will ever make, and to take it seriously. Everything needs to be thought (hard) about,  rationed out, and the best decision will surely come out of that.",
                "Daniel ": "Choosing the right college or university to attend is an important decision and therefore involves doing your research.  When choosing a college that best fits you as an individual it is important to consider the size, population, location, and learning environment of the schools that you are considering.  Make sure you figure out whether you prefer a large campus with a large population of students or a smaller campus with a smaller population.  Also make sure you choose a school that is in a suitable location where you will feel comfortable living for the next four years of your life.  Once you have figured these things out take into consideration student/professor ratio, extra-curricular activites, and sports.  With these things in mind you should have a pretty good idea on the school that is best for you.",
                "Christie ": "Students should keep a few things in mind when they are looking for the place to further their education, prepare for a career and most likely to call their home for the next two to five years.  Make sure you apply to both large and small schools.   This is important because you may think small campus are narrow-minded and expensive or that large schools are too spread out, but some schools have a personality that will surprise you when you visit yet feel like it is the right size.  Make sure to visit and sit in on a few different classes so that you know what to expect as far as class size, teaching styles, note-taking, etc; your first experience in a college classroom can be a little scary.  Learn the ins and outs of the housing situation, meal plans and public safety issues on each campus and be prepared to ask questions.  Once a freshman, make sure you familiarize yourself with your campus all of its resources.  A good, diverse social network, whether large or small  is crucial to your success and health, to help you  learn who you are and to develop and strengthen that person.",
                "Carrie ": "Make sure to visit the colleges you are considering, and, if possible, do an overnight visit. It gives you a much clearer viewer of life on campus.  And always ask questions!!!!",
                "dave ": "relax, its all easy",
                "Melissa ": "My best advice in choosing a college is to know exactly what you want in each aspect of the school. You should base your decision on the size of the school you want, the majors they offer, the social life, academic support, and definitely the financial aid that's offered. Especially if money is an issue, you should make sure to talk to someone in financial aid before choosing a school. I also strongly suggest going on a tour of every school that you may have the slightest interest in, because you will be surprised about how different a school is compared to what you expected. Once you choose a school and enroll yourself, definitely make sure to check out the social activities that go on at your school and get yourself involved immediately.  This gives you a greater chance of eventually holding leadership positions, which is one of the most rewarding aspects of college life.",
                "Jennifer ": "My advice is to take your time to visit each school and after each visit write a few things down you really liked about the school and some you didn't like.  Also if you get a chance take a couple pictures or grab several brochures and file them away with your pros and cons.  At the end of your college visits, pull all the info out and eliminate the ones you know you don't want.  Then while you are sitting there pondering over the colleges you absolutely loved think about three things, one will I be happy at this school based on who I saw when I visited and how friendly the campus staff and students were?, two does this school have the absolute best program for what I am interested doing career wise?, and lastly,  is this a school where I can be myself and be proud of who I am and be known on campus or will I just be a number in a large crowd?  Once you figure who you are and who you want to be your hopes and dreams will fall right into place.....    :)",
                "Anjali ": "I suppose the only real advice I could give to students and their parents for finding the right college is to shop around. Whatever your interests are, find a college with most of your likes, as well as similar morals and values. Visiting the campus and seeing how students interact with each other, as well as getting a feel of how classes are is another excellent way to help find where you belong. As for making the most out of your college experience, pick one, two, or three organizations you really like and join. Do not try to join every single one you like-- it is painful and stressful, trust me. Also, go with your instincts: if a place doesn't feel right it probably isn't for you, whereas if you feel like \"this is it\" then try it out! You will never truly know until you try: \"the difference between try and triumph is a little umph\" (I wish I remembered who said that). Most importantly, just be yourself. You are the world's greatest gift if you are simply and truly you. So be you and grow as an individual, and may your college experience be amazing!",
                "Bryan ": "When you visit a school, you need to feel at home.  It has to be the right atmosphere for what you're looking for.  You need to take a tour, have an interview with an admissions counselor, spend the night on-campus with a student, visit classes, talk to professors from the department of your interest and make sure it all fits for you.  There is no exact formula to find a college.  As you look, each student is going to tell you why they loved their school, and it is your job to analyze that response.  Not every school is going to \"fit\" every student that comes to visit it.  Sit back, take a deep breath and follow your heart, because the fact of the matter is, if your heart is not there, it will be very difficult for you to put your money forward to that institution to pay for your education.  Most important thing to remember, ask the questions that you  want answered; don't be afraid to ask!",
                "Salaam ": "Schedule a personal tour with the admissions staff, take a day off of work and school, and travel to the college as a family.  You will experience an excellent tour without having 20 other people sauntering along with you on open house days.  Come prepared with a list of questions regarding financial aid, housing, dining, and extracurriculars.  Many of those questions will get crossed off during the tour, but be sure to cross the rest off before you leave campus!  Don't be shy about your questions because you or your child could very well attend that school for the next four years.   Oh, and quick tip, when financial award packages have been awarded and you have taken a seat in the incoming class, be sure to stop by the financial aid office within the first few weeks and ask VERY politely if there happens to be any floating financial aid from the students who dropped out.  Students, you just might get lucky.  If not, don't be afraid to take out loans.  99.9% of people take out loans.  Work your butt off and get a great job and pay them off!  Now enjoy your four years!",
                "Krystal ": "Finding the right college is always a difficult decision to make.  Every school offers something slightly different compared to the next one.   Comparing each college down to the smallest items is a great idea when picking a school because I think this helps in students never transferring and finishing at the same college.  Though whether a student decides to transfer is not the most important item here.  When comparing apply to the schools you narrowed down to because if you're indecisive of where to attend, like most young adults are, the schools will then decifer whether you get in to their school.  Also I think the next important factor is how personal you want your experience which involves if the school is small or large.  I prefer a one on one with a professor to learn as much as possible so I attended a small school.  Attending a small school also helps with the going out and party scene, there's less distractions in this area.  Attending a big school like penn state there's many of these distractions.  Lastly, from beginning to the end, you should be applying to the best school for your major.",
                "Erin ": "Visit all colleges of your choice so that you can make the right decision.  Be sure to inquire as to if they have things of your interest and ask about the crime rate and safety measures.  It is very important!",
                "Christine ": "The first thing I would suggest is try to visit any colleges that you may be interested in.  When you visit, talk to people and ask many questions as you need to. This is your future, so you are allowed to be picky.   I would also suggest to research the extra curricular activities.   I came to my college because I was told that there was a girl's lacrosse club team.  When I got here I found out that the team broke up a year ago and I was very disappointed.  You can find out if there are clubs and groups for things that you are interested in.  Clubs and organizations are one of the best ways to meet people.  My third suggestion is to have a good balance between academics and social life.  I'm a big believer that in college, education comes first and fun comes later.  On the other hand, it necessary to get out there and have a good time with your friends.  It is important to stay focused and remember why you are in college, but it is also important to take a breather and let your hair down.",
                "Mackenzie ": "Allow enough time to research and visit each college and make a list of those items which you feel are important so you can compare.  You will usually feel comfortable on campus if the school fits you, otherwise, ask for an overnight stay.  This will really help you determine what the campus and housing is like.   If you love sports,  you can achieve good grades along with playing a sport.  You just have to work hard at what you want and anything is possible.",
                "Greg ": "You really should know what you want to do when you come to college! I know people figure it out when they get there, but you should really research things before you go to school! If i knew everything in High School that i know now I would have made a much better college choice. Albright College is amazing, but I could have made a better choice that's good for my major.  I love Albright. I've made some of the best friends i'll ever make in my life, but it's not academically up to par as it should and could be!",
                "Paul ": "I would say that make sure you visit multiple schools. Become knowledgable about not only the school but the surrounding area. Spend time on campus with current students to get a feel for campus life and academic life.  Make sure when you visit that you have a list of questions that you may have regarding, academics, finances, extracurricular activities, etc. so that you can get all your questions answered.  If available, visit a classroom in your desired area of study, so you can get a feel for the academic demands. If you do all these things at every campus you visit, you will be sure to pick the right place for you. Also, be sure to apply for all the scholarships and grants that you can. Every little bit helps.",

                "Meredith ": "Parents should play an active role in finding a college: going on campus tours with the students, reading through brochures and catalogs, talking about possible selections, etc. I think it's imperative that parents support the student's decision about which college they want to go to. Even if the parent doesn't think the college is good enough or a right fit for their child, it is ultimately the student's choice,  and the student will feel better about their selection if they know their parents are behind them, no matter what.  The student should make their choice after visiting campuses and doing as much research about their schools as possible.  Based on their goals for their college career (what classes they want to take, how socially active they want to be), they should choose a school that would help them achieve those goals the best. Once their college life starts, they shouldn't let any opportunity pass them by. Participate in all the classes and extra-curricular activities you want. Enjoy it while you can, because these are supposed to be the best years of our lives.",

Just give it a chance.",

                "Comment": "I personally feel that Alcorn State University is a 2.5star school. I say this because ever since I have started my education journey here in the fall, I have felt completely lost. I do not like the fact that the Biology department does not have a set advisor for each student. This causes conflict because when you meet with one advisor they give you a set amount of information about your course curriculum. The next you may not be able to see that specific advisor, so you meet with a different one and they give you a totally different set of information. The problem then becomes choosing whose advice to take. Another issue is the overcrowding of classes. This semester my microbiology lab class was cancelled because the registrar\u2019s office made a mistake and booked two different classes at the same time and place with the same teacher. This also causes conflict because now I have to worry about whether I will be able to take the lab at a different time without it conflicting with any of the other courses that I am taking this semester. This semester and a half has been very stressful so far. I came here as a transfer student and was not offered help or assistance from any staff, I learned all of the information I know now from asking other students. At the beginning of the year, the school has an informational session for the new students meaning, freshmen. The transfer students were not acknowledged at all. We were basically just left to find out everything on our own. I feel the main thing Alcorn needs to work on is being more informative and more student-oriented. Meaning all students should be shown the same amount of attention and giving the same amount of assistance whether it be a new freshman or a transfer student."

Even though as some may classify us being \u201cin the woods\u201d we always have something to do. The student body is what makes Alcorn Alcorn . Although, I feel like our food choices could be better, and also our  living conditions, considering most dorms have been here since the 1800\u2019s, I feel like Alcorn should remodel and rebuild our dorms. Even though they have made new dorms that are apartment style, all students can\u2019t fit in those dorms which means a lot of students are in the older dorms, that have been there for over decades. You may hear people say \u201cAlcorn is not built for the weak\u201d that is why .

I would tell myself that guys could most definitely wait until a later time and just focus on furthering myself and being a little selfish and being all about me. I would tell myself to continue to be my primary advisor because sometimes academic advisors can put a girl on the wrong path. I would also tell senior me to visit my faculty advisors early because they provide so much information and aid, and both women (with doctorate degrees) are so motivating and want nothing more to steer me in the right direction. I would leave with a slight push.",
                "Roneshia": "Transitioning from high school to college was a major step. The only advice that I would have given myself was not to eat every single day in the campus cafe. I took it as a joke when I heard people say they gained the Freshman 15, but now I know it is nothing but the truth. Other than that, nothing else came as a surprise. I was aware of what I was going into.",
                "Shanta": "I would tell myself to apply for as many scholarships as possible. I would also tell myself, even though my ACT score was acceptable for the university I wanted to attend and I already had a scholarship; I still should have retaken that test as much as possible to improve my score as much as possible.",
                "Draven": "It\u2019s the beginning of something amazing!  I\u2019m here to tell you, it\u2019s okay to make mistakes, everyone fails before they make it big.  When you're in college, what you learn is entirely up to you; if what you learned excites you, chase that passion relentlessly.  If you get stuck along the way, its okay to ask questions; believe me, you may think you have it figured out, but you don\u2019t. Yes, its college life, and I know you want to have fun.  Keep in mind there will always be another party. You can save some money by choosing the parties wisely.  While you're there develop a budget, you will thank me later.  In college get involved with educational clubs on campus and extracurricular activities, you won\u2019t regret it.  Remember that education is not a race; you WILL get to the finish line.  Last but most certainly not least enjoy the experiences you have during college, you will miss them more than you think.  The decisions and experiences you encounter in college can affect your entire life.  Some of those decisions may have been bad, just think about what you have learned from them.",
                "Ashlee": "If I could go back to my senior year in high school, I advise myself to do more research and look at more schools. I was more set on going to a particular school and following my own plan for my life; which ironically is the exact opposite of what happened and how I ended up attending ASU. Research is a useful skill especially for collegiate purposes not only that, the more information you have to work with the better the chances are that you will make the best decision. I didnt get a chance to choose my destiny in this situation, it chose me. So to help elevate some of the stress and anxiety associated with this transition and college life in general; I take control, of yourself, your journey and in the end your success! Do your research, come prepared and I know you can execute, so thats no worry. College is what you make it, but the preparation is up to you.",
                "Christopher": "If i could go back in time and talk to myself when i was in high school there are a lot of social and academic advice that i would give. First of all, in college I would tell myself to always remember the importance of what comes first  in school and life. College is a big step and it is not all about partying and having fun you really have to be dedicated and focused on your long term goals without letting anything hold you back. I would be really careful to mention that education and a social life is something that has to be equally distributed throughout your entire college career. When it comes to sports, first you must always to remember that  without academics sports of any kind do not exist.  I would tell myself to not get attracted by all of the things that happen on campus because some of the festivities can hinder your focus without you even knowing it. Even though sports would have been my main hobby, I would have encouraged myself to try to be involved in other activities in my spare time. Being successful means being a \"Jack of all Trades.\"",
                "Carrie": "Hello past Carrie. This is your future self speaking. I know this is strange, but please hear me out. I know right now you think you have everything figured out, but college is very different from high school. So I am here to give you some well needed advice. There are three things I\u2019m going to need you to change in order for you to make it. Those are your study habits, your time management/priorities, and your relationship/friendships. \nFirst off, your study habits. It\u2019s time to start studying! I know in high school you can get by without studying, but college is different. There are going to be more lectures and professors are not going to waste time going over every small detail.\nNext, your time management. Stop procrastinating! Always use your time wisely and the quicker you get your assignment done, the better.\nLastly, your relationships. Don\u2019t get too caught up in what people say or feel about you. Trust me, life goes on and you will meet new, exciting people. So if a relationship/friendship doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t sweat it.\nI know this advice will help you, so use it wisely!",
                "Tanisha": "I would tell myself that college is no joke and that everything I do determines not only my future but me as a person. I can and will perform all academic tasks to a high degree of competence. I will prepare consistently because it reflects a commitment to become a productive member of society. I will respond to advice and criticism in a positive way.  I would consistently demonstrate the highest personal and professional qualities during my undergrad and graduate experiences at Alcorn State University. Through good citizenship, high achievements and persistence, all proves I have the ability to succeed. No matter what I do, I am a leader. To always feel that I am a strong candidate for  whatever I\u2019m doing because even with the obstacles in my life that most people don\u2019t have, I can overcome them and succeeded.  No matter how hard the situation is, or people telling me I\u2019m not going to make it, I can do whatever I put my mind to.",
                "Lauren": "When looking at universitys for athletics pay more attention and start earlier. Talk to the coaches to see if they actually know what they are talking about. Visist the university before committing, pick somewhere that snows, humididty is awful. Do not be so shy, your future bestfriends are utterly amazing, and yes you will need a textbook for every class, try harder to get more finicial aid to afford those books, soccer scholarships do not cover every expense. Go to every special guest speaker at Alcorn, they are amazing and insperational. Get a meal plan with next to no meals in the cafe, that should have been your first hint, it is called a cafe, not a dinning hall. Smile and work hard, Pre-season will fly and so will the school year. Enjoy the university you choose, and love your teammates.",
                "Dominique": "When I became a senior of Greenville- Weston High School, I had mind set on graduation day. After I walked acrossed that stage to receive my diploma on May 24, 2012, I was excited to get away and experience this new chapter called college. However, my mind was set upon only the positive outlooks of being a college student, such as meeting new people, living on my own, and doing whatever I please. When I entered the gates of Alcorn State University in August 2012, my life automatically changed for the better and worst. From a positive outlook, the college life has taught me how to do a lot for myself, such as being punctual, responsible, and precautious. On the other hand, I have discover some bad habits that the college life has developed within me, such as having Freshman 15, laziness, and experiencing social activities that negatively affect me. As a current college freshman, I have learned that college can make or break someone. If I was to go back into time to give myself advice when I was in highschool, it would be to focus on my future first before settling for my desires that can done later.",
                "Cierra": "If I could go back in time I would tell myself that following your high school boyfriend to college could be the biggest mistake of your life. I would tell myself to explore your college options and choose a place that fits your personaity and who you are. I would also tell myself to enjoy senior year so that you won't enter college with any regrets. I would let myself know that going through your freshman year wishing you could go back and re do senior year because of that same boy ruins your first year of college experience. I would also tell myself to follow your dreams no matter what because you get one life and one chance. The biggest piece of advice I would have to give myself would be that if its meant to be, then it will be.",
                "Deloris": "If I could go back to talk to myself ,when I was a high school senior, I would start by saying that I am very proud of you for making the decision to continue your education and better your life. I would say to myself, you set a goal and had a dream and went for it no matter how hard and how scared you were in moving away from home. Yes, it was the right move to make. Stay focus, don't have to much fun on your down time. Don't every forget to pray and thank God for your blessings. Don't forget where you came from and lose who you really are. If you keep focus on your goals you will suceed in the creer of your choice.  You will become a contributing entity to socity. Don't worry about your health,  God will take care of you. The camps is so beautiful, with most of your class mates attending from high school, you will be just fine.",
                "La'Toya": "If I could have such a wonderful chance to go back in time and talk to myself to better my near future, it would be quite forefeeling. There are many things I wish I knew back then. The most important things I would teach myself would be balance, to dedicate myself to achieve my full potential, and to make better decisions. If only I could have made a few minor adjustments to my life, how much better I would have been. Decisions make cause and effect type reactions, which can trigger good or bad outcomes.\nMy days as a senior were not the easiest days. Balance is something I merely lacked. If I could have slowed down to go home to study,maybe I would have been better off, but coming home from work late trying to do homework when I\u2019m exhausted was very tiring. One talk with myself would have brightened my future. I wish I could have told myself to never doubt yourself, to live up to your full potential. All I needed to do was fully dedicate myself. If only I had gotten that extra push, motivation to pull through. Perseverance is something I would demand.",
                "Mandy": "The opportunity to go back in time and speak to myself as a high school senior would prove invaluable.  I would take the time to tell myself to never stop believing in my dreams, and take every opportunity that presents itself.  I would tell myself that I am everything that I need and that I can finish every dream that I have started.  I would not allow myself to give up or doubt that I have everything it takes to transform into the nurse and professional that I am currently working towards.  I would put confidence and determination into the heart of my younger self and allow myself to see through my wiser more mature eyes.  I would tell myself that every opportunity is God's way of letting me know that, \"You can do this and I have bigger plans for you!\"  I would let myself know that life proves hard, but not harder than what I can overcome.  I would empower myself and set my heart on the goals and dreams that now motivate me to obtain more and better for myself and my family.  I would tell myself to have confidence, hope and to always love myself!",
                "Makyla": "The advice I would give to myself is to not fold to peer pressure and always stay true to yourself. Don't let new friends or a new surrounding determine the kind of person you are. If you have to change anything about yourself, no matter how small, then maybe the person or the situation isn't worth it. If it was meant for you to do certain things and act a certain way, you'd have ALREADY been doing so. Don't change, remain the same because that's whats so unique about you. . . you're you.",
                "RoSundra": "Being a student here at Alcorn State University has shown me many things. Knowing what I know now about collage there are many things I would tell my younger self if I had the chance. I would firstly tell myself that collage is indeed a challenge, but if I stick to studying I will do great. I would tell myself that there are many things that will distract me and try to come in between me and my coarse work, but I have to stay strong and push myself. I would also tell myself that being closer to God will not be such a bad idea either because as I get older there will be obsatacles in my way that will try to stop me from being successful and if i want to be successful in life, I cannot lose focus on what is more important. As a young adult looking back, I would give myself the advice of not hanging around the wrong crowds becuase hanging around the wrong crowd can sometimes put me in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong things. I believe that if I had followed this advice it could have helped.",
                "JaLeesa": "The advice I would give myself is to make better grades and to study harder. I believe if I would have did better and not have slacked off I would have recieved a full schlorship to werever i wanted to go.",
                "Ronnie": "Growing up I was quite naive as we all were. I did a lot of things that I regret and it's a lot of useful intimations that I would go back and refer to my younger self. I definitely could've used that then. I was ignorant in my younger years I didn't have open ears during those times. A lot of what I acccomplished that year was my own fault. If i could go back and talk to myself I would advise myself to make the most out of those high school days and enjoy every moment. I would have known that you have to be adroit and know how to plan out your schedule. I would've told myself about being more active in school activities and being more into school itself.  It's a priveledge to be able to attend a college. I would have told myself to study harder, play basketball, get the girls I really wanted. I would send myself fully preparedto go in the world on my own. If that was possible it would've been alot easier back then it those golden days that I miss so dearly.",
                "Regina": "The advice I would give myself as a high school senior would be as follow: College life is very exciting but understands that you are a new student at a new school and you have a great deal of responsibilities. Even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it at first, you will soon realize how full your plate really is. The main piece of advice I can give you is to always go to class and be on time. Regardless of how you feel in the morning, get up and go to class. Being an attendance in class means a lot to the teachers and speaks highly of your character. I understand that you are familiar with a tardy bell in high school but in college there are no tardy bells. Another piece of advice I can give you is to manage your time wisely. You will have a lot of free time on your hands so when a teacher gives you an assignment, go to the library and complete it the same day the teacher gives it to you. Do not procrastinate on any assignment because you will stress yourself out when the due date becomes closer.",
                "Jazmine": "I would most definitely go back and tell myself to save more than half of my pay checks. I would start budgeting now on the stuff that I think I might need while in college. I would tell myself to apply to all scholarships that I am qualified for. I would tell myself to take the ACT everytime that it's offered and just not when I've scored the score I wanted. I would tell myself to start preparing my mind now, and not wait until I get to college and prepare then.",
                "Sabrina": "If I could go back in time and give myself advice about college, I would say a lot. The most important advice I would give would have to be that if you are going to have your best friend as your roommate, be prepared for what could happen as a result. Keep it in mind that everyone you meet is not your friend. Everyone has intentions whether they are good or bad, so be mindful of how you treat people and of what you say around people. Also, never put friends or anything before your schoolwork. I did that my first semester. I had an A at midterms in my College Algebra class, but I ended up with a C because I neglected my work. So with that being said, I would advise you not to procrastinate either. Make sure you what you major in interests you, and get involved on campus. Lastly, never forget your roots. Remember who you are and always carry yourself well. Stay in church because college can either bring you closer to God or pull you away from Him. Stay focused and best of luck!",

Get those scholarship applications in early since the less you have to work to pay for books, the more time you can spend studying them!\n\n-Debt is Bad! Do all you can to get college paid for, as a debt-free start after college can leave you with the resources to take advantage of opportunities that would otherwise be impossible if you\u2019re paying excessive minimum balances.-Getting a degree doesn\u2019t guarantee a job!

So if I could go back in time to take to my high school self, I would tell myself to buckle down and get focused and decide now what I want to do and how I want to do it. Time is of the essence. I need to better my life physically and mentally. Don't be afraid to reach for the stars. Life is too short to play around and I should try my best to be a better me. I know you you can do it. I believe in you.",
                "Amber": "If I were able to go back in time and give my \"high school senior\" self some advice, I would have a lot to say. I would tell myself, first, to always seek God for my strength and to seriously get saved and confess Christ as my savior. I wasn\u2019t saved when I started college, but in my junior year I did genuinely surrender myself to God. Christianity is more important to me now that it ever has been, and I know it will help me stay strong in school. Next, I would tell myself to stay focused on my school work and studying; to not get lazy when the work gets hard. Don't be afraid or too shy to seek help and tutoring when needed. Do not rush into a relationship because it may cause unnecessary stress, and it may also be unhealthy and cause me to not focus as hard as I need to on course-work. Also, to seriously figure out who I am and who I would like to be, and to have a strong character and discernment when associating with people and gaining friends. This would be great advice, knowing what I know.",

                "Marcus": "If I could travel back to my senior year, I would have a very indepth talk with my younger self. I would tell young(er) me to not allow yourself to be \"shoe-horned\" into the same group of friends you came in with. Alcorn is a family oriented school, and nearly all of the people there are more than willing to help those in need, you could easily branch out and meet people that will have great and positive influences on your life. I would also tell myself to experience all that life has to offer. Over these four years you will be given opportunities to live life to its fullest, take full advantage of them. Do not let anyone hold you back from your goals or from enjoying this time, because you never know if you will have as free a time as this. I wouldnt want to give myself too much advice, for fear of changing the experiences that I have had over these four years. My time at Alcorn has been the best years of my life, and I am eternally grateful for them.",
                "Alecha": "If I could go back in time and talk to myself as a senior in high school the best advice I could give is \"To thine own self be true.\" Transitioning from high school to college is an exciting time but staying true to yourself and keeping always keeping your goals in front of you will be extremely helpful in a new setting. You will meet people with extremely diverse goals, backgrounds, and personalities. It is very easy to lose sight of yourself being surrounded with a slew of wonderfully interesting new people. My sophomore year I began working as a Resident Assistant on campus and I was exposed to a whole new social scene. I met friends that I will have for a lifetime. But my GPA dropped drastically. The next school year was intense because I had to catch up. Yes, I was successful and my GPA is now average but many of my classmates flunked out. The most important thing you can learn in college is not taught in any classroom; who you are. Stay true to yourself and your goals and no matter where the path of life leads you will prosper.",
                "Burgundie ": "In my first semester of school, I have learned responsibility. In high school, I was taken care of by my mom who did everything for me. In college, I no longer had a person to confide in so I had to confide in myself to make decisions. When I decided to go to a HBCU, everyone thought that I was not making the right decision because I wouldn't be getting a diverse look at life. That is not so. At Alcorn State, I encountered all kinds of people of all races and cultures and everyone has a story. This is valuable because in the workplace your future boss looks at your ability to handle all situations and all kinds of people. With me being also in the band, I handle all kinds of attitude whether strong or weak because the band is a team just as college is a team.",

At Monroe Community College I am able to take a variety of classes and join many programs to help me make a decision. This college offers classes from Ancient Chinese History to Health and Safety in the Workplace. While being enrolled at MCC it has allowed me to take explore my options and understand all that i want to be. They give you the experience that you need to begin working in your desired field. I know that when the time comes to transfer to a four year school that I will not regret my decision for registering at Monroe Community College.",
                "Presha ": "While attending Alcorn State University, I have gotten the best that college life can offer. I have amazing friends, classmates, and professors, but most of all I have gained a solid education, alongwith southern heritage and a sense of our rich history.  I have learned how to accomodate to the worst of times and celebrate in the best of times which has ultimately made me stronger and more aware of who I really want to be. \n     It has been valuable to attend because I now know how to survive, adapt, and think clearly in challenging situations. Attending Alcorn has taught me to value education because the professors here value education and I believe cherishing education has been valuable in itself.   \n     I may attend a small, Heritage Black College/University, but education is very important to me. It is simply my last life line to make my dream a reality. My university may not get the best of the best; however, it produces the best of the best and I will never regret my choice of attending Alcorn State University.",
                "Johnnie ": "Out of my college experience, I have gained new determination and insight of myself. When you go to school, everyone has an idea of where they want to go with their major. But lets be honest, most people pick those majors because it is alot of money in that industry, but what happened to doing it because you are passionate about it! I love the way Psychology always changes, the way you can experiment and think of a new theory just by analyzing. It is essential to attend college to not only become independent but to learn more about your independence. It takes time to learn how to network, how to market yourself and that is what you learn in college. I would advise anybody to do any type of college, even if it is not a 4 year university.",
                "Katie ": "After a year away from school, college has been both a refreshing and a much-needed jump back into the productive and imaginitive world. One of the best parts about my collee experience has been meeting and working with so many interesting people from so many different sides of life. It's been inspiring to hear their stories, and it's been a real learning experience to be exposed to a variety of ideas different than my own. Now that I'm in a more serious, grown-up environment, I also have a greater appreciation for the education system itself. A lot of what I've learned can be directly related to the \"real world,\" which is something I feel was kept away from me in high school. With the freedom to take whatever classes I'd like, I've been able to focus my attention on a carreer in art, and now have a steady direction to work towards in the future. Without my college experience, I may never have been able to widen my gaze of the world and direct my personal efforts towards what I'd most like to do with my life.",

I would tell myself to go out and find some one who knows not only how to do the different types of research papers ,but some one who could have given me assignments to test my knowledge on research papers. I would tell myself to correct my english so that nothing I say may be interpected as an offense response. If I could go back to talk to myself I would tell myself what I tell middle and high school students now - Better yourself in all aspect now so that you may apply yourself more later, because in order to be some one or change some thing you must first prove yourself worthy of doing so.",
                "Brian ": "First i would tell myself to stay focus there are a lot of distractions in college. Which can lead to a downfall of a student. i would tell myself to be mentally prepared for the things to come like being on my own 2800 miles away from home.  Being that far from home you could easily lose your ambition and the will to get up in the morning for that 8 am class. The best advice i could give myself  is to keep my eye on the prize and look for what the future has in store me. Keep faith in myself and understand why you went to college. Not to be like everybody else but to make something of myself. With that i would be unstoppable.",
                "Donna ": "As a high school senior, I would advise taking more difficult classes.  The more difficult,  the better.  I would have been better equiped to handle these calculus & chemistry classes while a sophomore.  I love that my professors are easy to reach &  talk to now.  I wouldn't have to schedule these appointments for tutorials had I simply put in the work as a high school senior.  So, take the time to get to know the best teachers to prepare yourself for a successful college career.  My high school GPA belied the collegiate GPA I have now.  While in high school, you should also spend more time listening to people who have been when you're trying to go.  They will give you the best advice.  I'm trying my best to recollect everything my friends & family have told me.  I know that information will have most certainly come in handy when it cames time for financial aide & housing.  Thank goodness, I have a good academic advisor now & I had a good counselor during high school .  They both did a great job of keeping me on track.  Last but not least,  thank my parents.  They believe in me.",

For example would you take a student who grew up in the city life and stick them in a school in the  country. The student would not feel comfortable and would not apply themselfs to do their best.

In choosing a college that is best for the student , consider every aspect of the school and child possible. Make visits to all schools and consider all schools. Look for home/family based campus settings. Look for colleges that support majors and arts, culture and ethnicity. A school with a high percentage of diversity will be a great experience. Make sure the credibility of the school is up to part and be sure to check the status of academics. Talk to professors, administrators, even students just out and about. Make a personal checklist for yourself and try to obtain one from either a high school/ college counselor and check each item off that applies to each college being considered and the college that fits the checklist the most should trigger your decision."

You see everybody almost everyday, yet still find new students to talk to and new friends to connect with. Alderson Broaddus provides every opportunity for you to succeed. Our little campus on the mountain is a place that can easily become your second home.\n\nThe campus comes to life everyday, from students hanging out in the Cave or the student center to many embarking on their daily strolls to class. The atmosphere is mainly surrounded around athletics, with over 80% of the students enrolled being student-athletes partaking in NCAA Division 2 competition. I will admit, it is rare to see a NARP (Non-Athletic Regular Person) on campus, but it does not mean you are not welcome!\n\nThere is almost always something to do on campus. From color runs to dodgeball tournaments, there is always an event open for students to get out of their dorms and be active. You have very many opportunities to unwind or work out after spending all day in the classroom, with offered yoga and Zumba classes to kick you into shape while having a blast!\n\nThough I am only a freshman here on campus, I have nothing but kind and positive words to say about this school; Alderson Broaddus University - you can do that here. \n"

I tried my best in high school and it took me very far. Im learning a lot such as time managment, living 800 miles away from home, and more which have helped develop me into a young man. So to be strait forward, I wouldn't tell myself to do one thing different in fear that I would change the future. I have no regrets and thats how I live my life.",
                "Zachary": "I come from a family in which college isnt a norm. I am one of the first in my family who has made the commitment to a college education. If I was in a situation where I can go back in time to give myself advice there are a couple things I would highly recommend to myself. First, I would focus on studying. The high school that I had attended did not exactly require studying skills for education. Yes, application was necessary, but I lacked on the study techniques. Without realizing it, by not developing good study skills I was only putting myself behind in the race before the gates were even opened. Even though I have learned the hard way, I have already developed some base of study skills that are allowing me to score higher on my tests. Another important peice of advice I would acknowledge myself of if I was able to go back in time is priority. What may be first on my list of things I want to do, may not necessarly benefit my future's results in the greatest way possible. Organization and prioritizing are a couple things I have been currently working on.",

At first, I was scared to go to college.  I didn't know anybody.  I barely knew the town I was in, but after a few semesters, it started to feel like home.  I learned how to go out by myself and not feel completely awkward.  I learned that I can live happily and successfully by myself if I have to.   I've also learned to appreciate my hometown more.  Since being away, I'm more excited about attending high school games and meeting up eith old friends.",
                "Chad ": "College has given me so much since I have been in high school.  What I mean by this is that i have learned about myself, not only other individuals. Doing this gives yourself a way to see how you compare to some of the world. When a anybody realizes what is happening around them gives them a better chance of being successful. I have learned how to study in/out of the classroom plus helping other classmates and friends with my experiences. This is not to say that I have helped some other person but to give a prospective to that person that I never did get. With these attributes that I have acquired I'm stonger, smarter, and better person. I understand that there is more to learn but for the moment these are the things I have learned from the first two years of college.",
                "Jordan ": "First off, don't slack!  I know you're good at getting by with A's and B's with fairly little effort in most of your easier classes, but that really doesn't help when it comes time to study for the harder ones.  It gets you out of the habit and makes you want to fall back into the bad one of slacking.  There are always going to be things you would rather be doing, but succumbing to that feeling won't get you anywhere in the real world.  When you get to college and have all this spare time on your hands, you're going to have to choose between studying or playing and relaxing.  Of course, the latter two are way more inviting, but when it comes down to a test, you're going to wish you'd have studied more when you had the time.  Cramming for a seven chapter biology test is not fun.  Now, of course, you will have to slow down and take a breather every once in a while; if you didn't you would have a breakdown.  Just get into good habits now, and it'll make things easier later.",
                "Amber ": "Students want to figure out what type of class size they are comfortable with first, then look at the area, financial aid, and how helpful the administration is. Usually the admissions office is a good place to get a good look at the overall attitude of the school.",
                "Alyssa ": "Don't slack on the first test. You need to study. No matter how ready you thought you were for college and for the hard work, you need to do more. College isn't as easy as high school was for you. You're going to need to work harder and put in the extra hours of studying.",

                "Tia ": "The most important advice I would give is to first speak the professors one on one.  If you didn't get along with them when you met them, then you never will.  Talk to the students.  Don't just talk to the people that look like your friends from highschool, but pick random people and ask them there opinion.  Someone will give you the truth about the school.  Pay attention to the students attitudes walking around.  Ask yourself if you could fit in there.  Most people go away to college far from home, so you have to make sure that the place you are going to go can become a home away from home.",
                "Anna ": "Let the student pick the school.  That is where the student will be living for the majority of the next four years.  If the student does not feel at home at the school, the student will not have a fun, rewarding college experience.  There needs to be communication between the parents and the students so that both are happy with where the student is going.  The parent should encourage the student to apply to certain schools, but should not pressure or force the student to go to a particular school.  Also look at the classes and class size.  The student needs to pick a school that has an environment the student can learn and succeed in.  Once in college, get involved with the college community and organizations.  This is the easiest way to find friends.  Don't worry about making friends in college, because, if the student picks a school that the student feels comfortable in, the student will find a group where the student belongs.",
                "Krystal ": "I would advise everyone to experience their college in person before making any decisions. You should talk to the students and faculty and not be afraid to ask questions about the religion and politics of the campus because those things can make a huge difference in how comfortable you'll be at the campus. Many colleges offer \"Senior Sleepovers,\" where a prospective student can spend the night in a dorm with a current student and attend classes the following day, as well as meet with financial aid and academic advisers.  Senior Sleepovers are a great opportunity to really get the feel of the campus and decide whether it is the right place for you to spend the next four years of your life. The most important advice is to get to know the campus and the people before you make the decision: be abosolutely sure this is what you want.",
                "Sara ": "I would tell parents and their children to make the right choice for you, don't go to a college because your friends are going there or because your parents went there. Find a college that works for you, one that offers the educational path that will lead you to your dream job.",
                "Kayla ": "In my own opinion, I think it is very important to look a lot of schools. I personally only looked at 2 schools that were completely different from each other so it was easy to pick the one that I favored more. I think students need to be exposed to everything their school can offer (from housing to athletics to social activities) in order to decide what would be their best fit.  I also think that it should be the student's decision, with little input from their parents because if you are not completely satisfied in where you are going your chances of being and staying happy in that place are slim. As far as making the most of a college experience, I have found it very important to get out of your room and take advantage of all the activities your campus has to offer! Even if you don't like what is being offered, chances are that there is someone else that agrees with you. The more time you spend making friends and being active, the happier you will stay and the more enjoyable your education will be for you.",
                "SarahJean ": "In order to find the college that's right for you, make sure that you know what you want to get out of your career at school. Once you know that, you can lookat what all your potential schools have to offer and make a better decision.  To try to make the most of your experience, just take the opportunity to try as many things that you think you can handle.  Have a variety of activities as well as making sure you do all your work."

                "Jordan ": "The best thing about A-B, to me, is probably where it is located.  Philippi, WV is a small town where it seems like everybody knows everybody.  Even though there isn't a lot to do outside of campus, the town has a friendly atmosphere, and the fact that the school isn't in a huge city with tons of places to go means that there are less distractions when it comes time to study.  However, if one finds oneself with some free time, Philippi is within driving distance of many bigger cities that have more to do and see.",

The art program is insane but it has to be, and for that my class and I are far better artists now than we were at the beginning. This school really opened my eyes and helped me expand and explore my limits and the limits of art itself. It's also a fantastic community, better than any other, and as far as food goes, the Moka Joka in Harder Hall will help you survive. All the struggles of attending are entirely worth it, it's only four stars for the food at Ade. Also, if you're a first year in the art program, stay strong, and make work that you're proud of. "

The Art program is more than I ever dreamed of, its amazing.  All the students and faculty are so kind and helpful. We even tried the campus food, it was delicious and so much variety to choose from . My Mom cooks everything homemade and delicious, those were big shoes to fill. I visited a lot of schools but at Alfred I felt the most comfortable.  I am so excited to be a student in the fall."

                "Comment": "Alfred is a school that allows students to find themselves and prosper. The dorms are slightly awful and need updating, but they aren't disgusting (only the bathrooms). The food is hit or miss, but breakfast is always good. They offer so many opportunities to see guest speakers, indie movies, art shows, concerts, dance shows, comedians, live entertainment, and job/ career fair. The staff in the Career Development Center are so wonderful and will help you write or get an interview to almost anything you want. Football games are the Saturday afternoon thing to do, and local restaurants are fairly decently priced with such yummy food. The small town atmosphere is so fun, but there's very little around to do. If you want to have a life off-campus, you want to have a car on campus. "

                "Comment": "My opinion is that Alfred University is a great school for artists, but not much else. It's a very beautiful school but there is just not much to do here.  They have a good business program though. I spend most of my weekends inside because I'm not a big partier, but those who do party have a fun time. I often get kind of sad because the weather is very cloudy often and there isn't much sunhsine. The dorms could use a little upgrade as they are a bit outdated. Overall the school is a very strong academic school, just kind of lacking on the student involvment and activities, potentially because of how isolated it is."

If i could go back now and change anything it would be my decision to go to a school that had football.

During the season i soon found out that these colleges take anybody they can get. I wish i had focused more on the other things i enjoy like playing the trumpet, leading and joining clubs, and doing community service for local groups like Habitat for Humanity.

This would give high school me a wake up call because being in a low income family, I would know how important this was; for not only me but also, my family. I would remind myself to study for my SAT. SAT scores play a big part in college acceptance and additional scholarship funds. While I was very involved at my high school, I didn't take the SAT as well as I know I could have. I regret not getting a higher score because I know how much impact it has financially. If anything, I would tell myself to enjoy my high school experience.

Through experience at two instituions, one a supportive community college and the other a politically charged liberal arts college, I have learned the value of deep engagement with self and with materials and ideas that I find interesting.  I have learned to be self-sufficient and how to advocate for the causes that are important to me.  I have become a better speaker, writer, citizen, and artist.  Some of these benefits have come directly from engagement with classmates, course material, and teachers; others have come from deeply felt opposition to restrictive or excessively competitive social and academic norms I was exposed to as a student.  Overall, my college experience has given me the confidence and tools I need to make my voice heard as a citizen of the world and to support myself and my future family.

I was sure, however, that I had set myself onto the path that I would be following for the next four years of my life.\nA year later, I had changed from a Psychology major to a Fine Arts major, broken up with my boyfriend, and moved in with a girl I had known for about a month. None of these changes to my life were easy, but as a second-semester junior in college, I feel that I would do it all again. Without the stress and the hard decisions, and the ways in which that forced me to be a flexible person, I would not be where I am today. I am happy.",
                "Stephanie ": "The first piece of advice that I want to give to up coming college students is to go to college. The experience is one that helps young people learn life skills. You will discover more about your self than you could ever expect to know. Most importantly you learn how to learn. I know that it sounds crazy but it is ture. In college you learn that teach yourself is the best skill to have best you will never stop learning in life.  The more that you know the more opportunities you will have to do what you love. So I would tell high school students to pick a school that gets you away from home, has great campus atmosphere and career place after graduation.  Those three things are the key. Lastly never give up on school.",

From the every day life style to the rarer opportunities in college, if you don't approach life?s tasks in college with an open mind, you will find yourself sorely unhappy.  You need to be able to laugh at the little things, like not having a can opener for your soup so borrowing the art students? tool kit to get it open.  You need to accept that people have different lifestyles, and make sure you respect their lifestyle choices.   Approach your classes with an open mind as well.  If you are stuck in a course you may not like because it is mandatory to take at your college, just think of it as a learning opportunity. The most important thing to remember going into college is that an open mind is your greatest weapon in college.  Without it, you are not going to receive the full college experience.",

I did my best but I also gave myself time to relax, make friends and do my thing.  I remember that as a high school senior, I was terrified of going off to college and living on my own.  If I were to return to that time, I would reassure myself and tell myself that there was nothing to worry about, and that everything would fall into place.

                "Mikki ": "I don't think I would give myself any different advice. I believe that the path I've taken since my senior year in high school has led me right where I want to be. My high school was probably one of the best \"transitions\" to college I could have asked for. It was not set up like the average American high school; rather it was modeled on a college.  The students were entirely responsible for their attendance and homework. There was no safety net of detention or phone calls to parents. We had to be organized and aware of our own education. We chose our own classes, we only had to be on campus when we had class.  Some very non-traditional classes were offered, which fit well with our school's non-traditional students. We were required to participate in the school's government. All said and done, I feel very privelaged to have been able to attend Liberty School, and I think it prepared me for college far better than any college prepatory school would have.",

Nobody understands the workings of a campus both academically and socially like the students.  Be mindful of location as it can have an effect on what activities are available, what the weather is like, and how easily available help is when needed.\n\nOnce there as a student, get involved by joining a club or a sports team.  Be social, work hard, and make sure to try new activities like karate, playing an instrument, or singing lessons.  Do a Study Abroad program, even if its a short-term program like a two-week trip to Europe.  It will all pay off in the long run.  Overall, have fun and enjoy everything you can.  An enjoyable college experience will stay with you for the rest of your life.",

Also consider a college with different options for a major in case you change your mind a long the way.  A big thing to think about is the size  of the school. Keep in mind that a small school can still have big opportunities and even better, there's more chances for you since their is less competition. Unless you're into the big name school which is good too, but don't go to a school because everyone's going there. It's very important that you choose the school that's right for you, and once you're there, be part of everything. Let the school remember you like you will remember it for everything you learned from your valuable experiences while attending.",
                "Joshua ": "I believe that one of the most important things that students and parent should consider when selecting the \"right\" college and making the most of the college experience is making sure the college offers soild academic preparation in the student's chosen major and soild career counseling.   The goal of any student selecting a college should be to chose the college that will best prepare that student for their chosen career.  This decision should not be made upon how \"pretty\" a campus looks or what famous person attended the college or how old, well known or how much or how litle the tution may be, or in some cases, how close or how far from home the college is located.   In these difficult economic times, it is vital that the workers of tomorrow be prepared to compete in a technologically changing, highly competitive employment  arena.  Due to the highly specialized and competitive nature of the world today, it is vital that the investment in higher education result in an strong return.  I firmly believe that choosing a college that fully prepares a student  for their chosen field is he most important  consideration in selecting an intitution of hgher learning.",

If you want a big city, country living, to get lost amongsdt the masses at a large class or to be noticed in a small community. I feel that each school caters to an individual you just have to find whats important to yourself and your future goals. To make the most of your experience is to sign of for all activities that interest you and to become involved in your community and surroundings. Enjoy your opputunities and the your choices.",

It's best to visit your chosen schools more than once, because weather can have a huge effect on the mood of the school, and a freak storm or sunny day can adversly influence your choice. Talk to people there, not just the tour guides. Tour guides are paid to make the school sound good, so do some investigating on your own.\nCheck up on what Alumni are doing too. This can give you a good idea of what graduates in your intended field have accomplished, and the more people that have been successful in that field, the more likely you will be to have a leg up when networking.\nAlso, ask people you admire where they went to school. Not only can they give you an idea of where you want to go, you can ask them what is important to them in finding a college. Perhaps passionate professors are what made them who they are, or a large campus with a lot of diversity, or tons of extracurriculers that really let them explore their interests outside of academia.",

It is important that you find the program(s) which fuel your passion.  Go and talk to the professors when you look at the school. Ask as many questions as you can before making your decision.  Find the community that you connect with. If it doesn't feel right when you visit then it's not for you.  In the end, go with your gut, you'll know you have the right school when it just feels good being there. \n \nImmerse yourself in this experience. Try everything. Be open to everything. College is not just about getting an academic education, it's about finding out who you are and how you fit into your community.  But most importantly, always keep asking questions!",
                "Caitlin ": "First and foremost check out what kinds of programs are offered at the school, this way if you go to school with an intended major but realize suddenly that you would like to change majors, the options are right there for you. Second, location. When visiting a school I highly recommend staying overnight or possible over a  weekend. If the college offers a weekend on campus, in the dorms experience for perspective students like Alfred University did, then I highly advise signing up. This way the perspective student gets a current student's perspective on what campus life it is like. It's a completely unimaginable experience, living away from home for the first time.",
                "Alisha ": "If you are interested in playing a sport at the college of your choice I would highly recommend doing an overnight trip as a recruit with one of the team members so that the prospective student will see what the college life is really like and can make an informed decision about whether or not the college is right for him/her. I would also suggest really exploring the campus and asking lots of questions. Make sure the setting is right for you too. If you grew up in a small, rural town maybe going to a college in a small, rural setting isn't the best place for you. Find out what the college is really like. If its a big party school and you want a more career focused school, make sure you find that out and avoid a huge headache.",

Administrators will tell you that you can take all the classes you want and that all your courses will transfer. What they wont tell you is that most of the time what transferes wont count for what you thought it did or for not as many credits, and alot of times you cant fit the classes you want due to all the major requirements. Expect to use more money than your planned, course materials are always getting more expensive and colleges have alot of extra fees they dont tell you about.

College transforms the way students lead their lives and challenges them to alter their perception of success. The classroom alone will not prepare students for the future, so when looking for a college, or persuing a fullfilling college experience, one should evaluate the degree to which their college(s) align with their personal interests.  If students learn enough about themselves, they will be able to better select the a college. When choosing a college it is benifitial to relfect on one's daily experiences, what is necessity and what is wanted. Find these things in a prospective college and find the right college. Observaion is the quickest way to get to know any campus community; students can see if they will fit  in if they observe daily campus interactions and apply them to their everyday life. These are the things that will make the college experience more enjoyable, but there are also the topics of financial aid, housing, and work in general. There is a lot of stress in college and having financial arrangements lined up ahead of time will greatly help in transitioning for students and parents.",

                "B. ": "You may not be able to find a school that feels like it is the best fit. Find a school that is similar to your interests and needs. You will find a way to make it fit.  The most important thing to have is the right facilities to do what you want. If you can do what you want at school then you will be more satisfied and  be able to make that place home. Once your there be open and outgoing. Saying hi to everyone as you move into dorms or your living situation really helps to meet new people and let the community know that you are an open and interresting person.  Try to spend as little time in your room. Dorms on all campuses tend to be a little depressing when you spend too much time in them. Get out into the community and meet people.",
                "k. ": "students: don't let anyone force your decision when you choose where to go to school--sometimes your gut instinct is the right choice. you have to choose a college where you feel welcomed but challenged, where you fit in but aren't just one of the crowd. college is primarily about learning about yourself: who you are, who you want to be, what you could be; how you interact with people and how you should or could interact with them; how the world can shape you and how you want to let it. you should come out of college feeling like you know who you are--but not necessarily what you want to do with your life.",
                "raymond ": "My advice to students about picking the right college is go and visit.  You get a different feel from each college that you will either love or hate.  I do not know where the feeling comes from, the buildings, the students, the faculty, they are all different.  You must also choose a school based on your extra curricular activities because they are what make your college experience exciting. I am on the varsity swim team.  As fun as homework is, I could not wait to get back in the pool and work my body after I had worked my brain all day.  When you go on a college visit, meet as many people as you can and ask them why they choose the college and why they like it.  If their answers match what you are looking for, you have found the right place.  Now it is up to you to make the most of your college life by meeting people and having fun.  Good luck!",
                "Sharee ": "When choosing a college, there are many issues that come up. A lot of students look at what schools specialize in their chosen field of study.   Some people base their decision on what university their friends will be attending or the college(s) that their parents graduated from.  However, I think it's important to note that not very many of us end up graduating with the degree we thought we would at age 18, and virtually none of us have the exact same talents and career goals as our parents or best friends.  So my advice is simply this: visit the school AT LEAST once.  Get a feel for the overall environment, as opposed to just the department you (or your family/peers) are interested in, because that will probably change, but the attitude of the place most likely will not.  Consider the other aspects of this decision:  location, for one.  Distance from home and from major cities, as well as climate.  More things to think about include class size, diversity, on and off-campus housing, and ease of student involvement.  Whatever you do, don't stress about it too much: college will do nothing but open your eyes!",
                "Christopher ": "When choosing the right college, the most important thing is to choose a college that reminds the student most of their own high school.  I went to a small school where I knew everyone in my class and the town was just as small.  That is why when I chose Alfred University, it is because it had that small town atmosphere that I grew up around.  Small colleges like this give a student an oppurtunity to get the help they may need during  a class. The small classes allow the student to have a one on one connection with the professor if they need the assistance with the material in class.  But once you choose the right college, the most important thing is to get involved with extracurricular activities and make true connections, because it took me four years to realize that my time here is short and I need to enjoy every minute of it.  College gave me a different perspective on life, so all I can say is just enjoy every minute you have at college, because there is nothing like it once your gone.",
                "Alanna ": "Don't rush it",
                "Kelly ": "My advice would be to pick a school that is the right size for you.  Whether you like one with a lot of students or only a small amount, you want to pick the right one for you.  Try and get as much financial aid as possible to help you pay for school.  Get all of your general education classes over with first while you decide exactly what major you want.  If you're going to commute to campus or have a car on campus, make sure there is enough parking on or around campus for everyone that may have a car.  Really think about how much you will eat at dining halls and get the smallest possible meal plan you can get to save money.  Talk to students and faculty that are already at the school. They can give you a lot of information about student life and the programs and facilities.  Try and see how helpful and friendly the staff are and if the students are happy.  Students should remember to work hard in college but also have a social life and have fun. You only go to college once.",
                "Meagan ": "Take your time to research a school and don't just pick a major to pacify your parents, take what you're excited to learn. You'll be happier in the end.",
                "Teresa ": "I believe that the students should tour a wide variety of colleges, to get a general idea of the campus they will essentially call home for the next several years.  Once  you find that college, return several times before the start of the school year to double and triple check that this college fits all your needs and wants.  A majority of the time, if the students do not take tours, or visit the school, they will not know what to expect  from the school and the surrounding community, and will be dissappointed.  Choosing a school is a very personal experience, one of the most important decisions that I've made in my life so far. Once you have found that school, and have applied, gotten accepted, and enrolled; I believe that becoming involved on campus is a very important aspect of the college experience. Many adults that I have talked to that attended college have found lifelong friends at their college, and are very glad they participated in the activities they did. College was a large building block in helping them become who they are today.",

                "Jasmine ": "Go with what feels right. The right place for you isnt necessary a school that everyone has heard of.",
                "Jessica ": "Before searching for colleges, decide on what you as a parent and the student want in a college. How big of school do you want to go to? How far? Major?, etc.  After figuring out what you do know, make visits to different colleges.  While at the visits, the student and/or parent will get an idea if  that college is right for him/her.  Also while at the visits, make an appointment with an administrative counselor for an interview. By having an intereview, the counselor will be able to not only answer any questions, but  the student is able to explain anything, express passion in what s/he wants to do with his or hers life and why that school is really important to that person. \nTo make the most out of the college life would be have an equal balance of social life with work like (studying and job). By doing this, the student isn't concentrating on school every second of the day, it'll give them a chance  for their minds to take a breather, but if you don't study enough and always have a social life, then your grades will suffere as well."

They spend millions of dollars on new facilities and still beg their alumnus for money. Even if we give one dollar, we get to be part of the statistic that says, 80% or whatever of our alumni give back! Isn\u2019t that nice? \nAt graduation, they literally gave us one dollar each and asked to give it back just to be part of the statistic. How sad is that? \nCheating the system just to look better.\nLet\u2019s not forget that they are a \u201cChristian\u201d college, but hold no such beliefs. \nStudents caught with drugs are kicked out, unless they are athletes, because President loves him some sports. \nLet\u2019s not forget the poor quality professors. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I liked several of them because they actually cared about what they were teaching, but I\u2019ll never forget the Political Science class I took that we talked about buying bacon online for 80 minutes. \nIf you ask questions concerning something you thought was wrong with the college, you are shushed away and scolded for daring to speak against the school, even if you just have a minor question. Constructive criticism is welcome in the classroom, but not to be practiced in real life, especially not against the holy and blameless one, the president. \nBut it wasn\u2019t all bad.\nAs I walked up the podium, and shook hands with the president, I knew only one thing.\nI loved Big Brother."

It\u2019s not a bad place but it is very secluded. There is a work study program that helps with paying off loans for the school. Overall not worth it if you have another place to go"

Coming to college is fun, don't get me wrong, but its a lot of work. You have homework, studying, work and so much more in college. In high school you didn't even have to study for a test and you could pass, in college you can study all week and barely get a C. It's good that you're focused on your future but if there is one thing I would want back, it would be just one more football game in the middle of the fall. Enjoy your life because eventually, college is going to take it over.",

I should have looked for at least one a day my entire senior year. College is not something easily payed for so scholarships are a neccesity and a blessing to have. I would also tell myself that I should have stayed in the regular classes instead of dual enrolling. I have always made great grades but the online classes I was taking was surprisingly challenging for me. At the time I did not know but it is common for some students to learn better in a classroom environment. Overall, I would tell myself to keep doing what I was doing, just change those things and I would be fine.",

I also will like to plan goals ahead that i have planned for my self. And i also liked high school when i was a  senior because we had class compentations  against each other then  the class that has the most points wins the compentation. That is why i like college because that is an great experience in my life you get to meet alot of people at the college that you don't even know and you can get to know them by being friends and talking to them. Alot of times  you can plan different goals for your life and how to manage them to your career plan in the future.

Time management is key is college. You have to go to classes, work, and make time to study. With all of this to do, students often get stressed and forget about having fun. If you don't make time for fun and friends you'll get burned out and not want to work as hard. Managing your time may seem difficult at first but will pay off later.

My mother often told me that if you can not attend a college on your own, then you are not mature enough to go away to college.  Don't go just because someone else is going there.  \nIn order to make your college experience the most that it can be is to make sure to get involved.  The local religious Student Union is a good place to start.  Then after you have become accustomed to the campus ,check a fraternity or sorority.   But don't worry ,if these are not for you, there are many other organizations especially volunteer or community action organizations that you can join.  Make sure to make friends that are around you first.  For instance, your roommate or other people in your dorm can become some of the best friends that you will have in your lifetime.\nThe bottom line is to get involved.  You'll have a wonderful college experience if you do.",

If you like art, pick a college that has a strong humanitities emphasis ect.  Pick a school that will allow you to express your self the way you wish too.  Also, you need to pick a college that wont distract you from doing your academic studies, because maybe a college with 3 bars on or around campus isnt for you, or isnt a good thing for you. And a word to parents, let you children choose where they plan to attend college, for it is their life, career and their choice.",
                "Eddie ": "Go and take a tour of the colleges you are interested in. I did and I fell in love with this campus. As for parents try to get the financial aid for your child in as soon as possible because the later it gets the less money you will have.",
                "Brad ": "I would advise students, and parents alike, to visit the campus' of the schools they are considering.  Visit with everyone.  Get to know the people on campus.  Make sure the school offers the program of study the student wants to pursue.  Secondly, the student  needs to assure they will be happyon this campus.  \nAs a parent of college students, as well as a college student myself, I would ensure that the campus is safe and that my child is going to be in a safe, secure learning environment.\nStudents get involved in activities on the campus.  Get to know the other students, the faculty, and staff.  This campus will be your home away from home.  Treat others with respect and kindness and the same courtesy will be returned to you.\nMost of all remember college is not just an educational experience in the classroom, but a learning environment in socialization skills and maturity.  \nParents remember the student who enter the campus as a freshmen are not the same people who will walk across that stage four years laters.  At this time they will be adult men and women who are ready to thrive and succeed in the world.",
                "Bethanie ": "As a sophomore at Alice Lloyd College, I can say that I am satisfied with my decision to be in the small city of Pippa Passes working towards my goals.  However, during the my final year of high school I was torn between living the city life at the University of Eastern Kentucky or going up a \"holler\" in the middle of nowhere to Alice Lloyd College. The adivce I would give to someone who is trying to find the right college is that they visit all of their options.  After visiting EKU, I soon realized that I would not enjoy walking the long distances between my classes and dormitory. At ALC I  know that most of my classes are in the same building, or just merely a hop and a skip away (which comes in handy during the rain). When looking for the right school, one must consider the atmosphere. Are the students at the particular college friendly? How about the professors? Once the correct college has been chosen, one must try to make the most out of their college experience by meeting new people by joining clubs and study groups; get to know peers and teachers alike.",
                "Sarah ": "When looking for a college to go to that accentuates you and what you believe in is hard in this day and age. However, when looking for colleges, I would recommend making a list of all the things you're looking for in a college and taking it with you when you go to visit the colleges you've applied for. This way you can remember what all you're looking for and what appeals to you the most. Also look at the cost of the college. The cost of going to college is a huge factor when looking at schools. It is one of the top reasons that people decide not to go to college. Speaking from experience, there were lots of colleges that I would've liked to attend but I couldn't because of the cost. Then I found Alice Lloyd College. It's the perfect college for me and I've never been happier. It feels like my home away from home. That's what people need to look for in a college. They need to make sure they're going to feel comfortale there and think of that school as their second home."

                "Comment": "This is the college that turned my life around. It gave me the opportunity to join a women's sports team which I had never done before. I had great coaches who motivated me to be great not only in sports but academics as well. Coaches show that sports performance is important, but academics are always the primary focus. The instructors are great always making time for their students. If they are unavailable during class, they all have office hours, and if students are unable to attend the office hours, they schedule an appointment at a different time. There is always campus security which makes the school feel safe and are even helpful when a student's car battery dies, or his or her keys get locked in their cars. There are many facilities that offer academic help such as the writing center and math center. There are also many clubs for each type of individual. Whether it is engineering, biology, or dance, they will have a place for you. The counselors are also very helpful with getting students prepared to reach their goals. If it were not for this school, I would not have gotten accepted to Sac State, Long Beach, CalPoly SLO, or SDSU. I recommend students to come here. It has very little distractions, and if you join a team, you create friendships that last a lifetime."

Allan Hancock College also provides online courses if they can't go to one of two campuses for any reason, but overall, both Lompoc and Santa Maria campuses, including online courses, can come in handy whenever one choice doesn't work out, but the other can."

Allan Hancock provides for so many on and off campus opportunities and is understanding for student's rigorous schedules. In the heart of a not-too-busy town, Allan Hancock is surrounded in small shops and joints to catch a bite to eat and study for your classes. Allan Hancock provides opportunities for students both in Santa Maria and their Lompoc campus, a city of Arts and Flowers. "

The professors really care about your success and often go out of their way to help you should you need it. The amenities are not too plentiful although it is a community college so thats what you'd expect.  "

It is so affordable with the help of FAFSA and other school tuition waivers for those that graduate from high school and go straight into a two year college. There are new grants and scholarships all the time to help you get through and what you need to push through your college years as a Bulldog! Highly recommend this college to anyone! The best so far!"

I have found that I need to remember that I am making myself better, something I know is hard but will pay off. It is hard, but I know college is worth it.\n\nWorking hard and giving it your all is also important because there are times when I remember not trying as hard as I could have. In the end, there is nothing I can do to repeat those moments; I just have to learn from them.

I never had the opportunity to be invloved in any school activities because I though every one was going to make fun of me. I was always afraid to speak when I saw something was wrong. I was afraid to throw my Ideas out in society. Some advices I would give to myself If I was to go back to college would be not to be afray to speak, to get my Ideas out in society. I would tell my self that in college its up to me to get any help and that in college its a totally different life. College is more of involvement with your society.

Advice I would really give myself is to stay more focused, dont always try to please people just please myself and spread my wings to all new things like classes, hobbies, interests and even peeople.

You can kiss your dream of starting Christian camps for children all over the state, country and world goodbye if you can't afford to go to college.  Even though you are a great student and excell in all your classes, college isn't going to work out if you don't have the means. You should be doing all you can to earn that money that will be so crucial to your future. So hop to it missy!

Considering the word \"education,\"  most people would say that you can't get one without thinking.  But is the reality of this process better off started by not thinking and simply doing? I believe whole heartedly that if I had stopped thinking about it and just did it, I would currently hold a colleg degree.

So, in 2008 I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and I will be attending Wallace State Community College for the summer of 2010.

My younger brother on the other hand, has had a difficult time with this transition. Watching him go through the emotions has been difficult for me and I wish I could have given him advice before his high school graduation. On that note, I started thinking more about my own transition. If I could go back in time and give myself advice it would be this - just because I had always been independent and taken care of myself doesn't mean that I shouldn't appreciate the support others can give you. I sometimes would shy away from other's advice thinking I could take care of myself, when in reality, I should have appreciated the support my family gave me.

Not only are you paying for tuition there is also the cost of books. My books for my classes last semster where are about $300 alone not including out of state tuition which at most campuses is three times the in-state tuition. Its amazing how many different scholarships/grants are out there.  \nI would also tell myself to save money like it was running out of style.  I would tell myself to have two jobs in High school because its imposible to do so in college. That way I would have a little nest egg of funds for when times got really hard.  Also if I could go back I would tell myself to work even harder academically because a lot of  Universitys require a high GPA as well as a high SAT score. The higher those two numbers are the more forgiving the college is when it comes to finacial aid. Lastly, I would tell myself to have fun because you only go to college once.",

Do research that will narrow down your career path; this helps in class and major selection.  Be resourceful during times of harships and patient with yourself.  Believe in your abilities.

When you walk on a campus you should feel as though this is where you belong and it should feel like love at first sight. If you don?t feel it, keep searching for that school. Do as best you can in your local school so that when you do find your dream school, you can attend it. Don?t gawk at the boy with a bone in his nose and if someone speaks Spanish put those three years of high school Spanish to good use.

I find it dangerous to look back because it just may lead to regret.  It?s not being fearful, it?s having the courage to tell yourself to stop going back and move forward. However, I will reflect a bit my senior year in high school. I remember most of my friends applying after one application after another and basically was on the ?right? track all through their high school years. I on the other hand, was never consistent enough to keep up with the others. My health issues got in the way of everything, but it also made me realize at the same time, ?Is doing what I?m supposed to do truly going to make me happy??\n?Is following the same path as the others suppose to mean I?m successful??\nI can?t blame myself, nor can I advise myself. I?m a college student now and and I know it?s going to get better in time. I'm ready now.",

I would explain to myself the necessity and importance of education at all stages, not only for what is learned scholastically but the value of life lessons including patience, organization, and communication that are learned in an academic environment. I would stress the way that future employment situations are influenced substantially by an applicants educational accomplishments.  I would also adamantly project how many more opportunities are available to those with a college education than to those without.

Now I'm taking classes that I am passionate about that will help me attain my dream of running my own restaurant. Before I dreaded going to classes and I constantly doubted what I was doing with my life. I am not enthusiastic about my classes and even have created a general plan of where I want my life to be in ten years.

I am alot closer now to being a little more mature but I still have alot to learn.  After graduation I decided to attend the local college here in town and then transfer to a university later. I think that was my best decision yet and I know if I would have went away to a university straight out of high school I wouldn't have made it  very far because I just wasn't ready for it.

I was worried that I would miss out on some opportunities by going to a smaller school, but so far my classes have been very enjoyable and I feel like I'm building real world skills that I'll be able to use once I graduate. The small class size is great, the campus is pretty calm overall, and the teachers are all easily reachable. There's always room for improvement, I would be interested in a little more activity going on at the campus,  and I've only actually been going here for one semester now, but it's overall been a great experience."

I don't care if they offer to pay your entire tuition, books and housing, it is not worth it.  They are die hard, to the bone racists!!!!!  There were at least two black students that ended up in jail.  High school students had to move away and live with relatives because of racial harassment at school that left them afraid to continue going.  The coach for Dunbar High School in DC, had his team walk off the field because the local team repeatedly used racial slurs.  I lived in the area for 7 years and left with a criminal record as a result of racist neighbors, law enforcement and judges.   "

My parents were willing to foot the bill at that time, now the responsibility of paying for college is all mine.  I would have been right out of high school with all of that knowledge fresh in my head.    Instead I had to learn Algebra and Chemistry after being out of high school for 25 years.  That was not any easy task while managing a home, child and job.    Also there is the fact that had I went to college after high school, I wouldn't have placed this financial hardship on my family by having to leave my full-time job, in order to become a full-time nursing student.

Your actions in your last  semesters of high school will count, and can affect a college's decision to accept you in to their school.  Make sure that you are talking to your counselor about college costs and about financial aid, loans, and even scholarships.  Have your counselor sit you down and discuss the pros and cons of loans until you understand in great detail. Education is a very expensive investment, so be aware of the expenses of the school that you decide to choose. \n\nThe transititon from high school to college can be rough, so make sure that when you enter college you are meeting with your advisor on a regular basis. This routine, will keep you academically on track. Also, do not be afraid to seek help in college. There are tutors and tutoring centers for a reason! \"The worst question is the question never asked.\" Make sure you are not to asking for help the night before your midterm exam.  \n\nCollege can be very exciting and fun at times, but do not get so carried away that you are having more fun than studying."

                "Comment": "In all Allegheny is a good college, and I find it hard to say anything bad about it. Class size really depends on your major and the classes you take. I'm an English major, but I have also taken art, science and history. The English classes are about a 10:1 on most days, with art taking the majority with a large 17:1 or a small 8:1 depending on if its a lecture class or a studio class. Overall the housing is nice, they are old buildings so their is always something up, but they keep it well in hand and up to date when they can. (they meaning the school) Social life depends on you, if you are a party person, you just have to look for one, and if your not there are a lot of other things that go on around campus. Most people are very friendly and would love to get to know you. But keep your head down during finals, mostly around upper classmen. The stress is palpable and you do not want that kind of energy. Sports are sports and a little hard to explain. Its like clicks, kind of like high school, but without the mean aspect, sometimes. Most people don't segregate themselves into their sports groups unless they are at practice, so you can still be social and not on a sports team. It does get cold there I have to say, very cold. Bring winter boots, umbrellas, warm coats and socks. Winter hits around late November and stays until February, and fall is not nearly as kind as you would think, but the building are heated and the campus is not to large to walk, even in the cold. Overall it is a great place to learn and get to know yourself as well, just know its going to be cold. I am a senior this year and have loved my time at the college and I'm grateful that I made the choice to go. "

The professors and administration were absolutely amazing, very liberal and very progressive. Compared to staff and faculty, the student population could be a little ignorant sometimes especially towards minorities. A friend described it as a \\\"literal night and day contrast\\\". During the day you were surrounded by free thinkers (professors, staff, etc) but at night it was not uncommon to be met with a disrespectful comments by a student who had not really been exposed to diversity. You get an an amazing education but it is a very remote campus with no access to city life so that can be challenging at times. There are plenty of opportunities for study abroad etc, and the office of career services, faculty, staff will move mountains for you to help you achieve your dreams to make up for the seclusion of the campus and the lack of diversity. You just have to take the initiative to knock on the doors and they will not only open those doors for you but do whatever it takes to help you."

                "Comment": "Overall my experience at Allegheny College has been fantastic. The institution is dedicated and strives to do what is best for their students. It is a very engaging place where I feel like I can thrive personally and academically.  Professors are always there when you need them. They push you hard to achieve your best but they do not let you drown.\n \n I can vouch for the English and History departments when I say it is a wonderful experience to learn from their faculty.  It is never boring and they cover their subjects in a complex and global way that challenges your thinking not just on the topic of that day or week, but how the topic or subject is relevant to the rest of the world.\n \nWe are required to fulfill a distribution requirement in order to graduate. This means (being a Liberal Arts college) we have to take classes in divisions that are outside our major. I am an English/History Double Major and I have taken classes in Political Science and Geology. This has helped me think in different ways and broadened my experience as a student and as a person.   \n \n The student body is considerate, friendly and aware. No they are not all perfect, because it\u2019s college and there are jerks wherever you go. But for the most part it is a positive social environment. \n \nThere are many student run clubs and organizations on campus to get involved in. We have everything from the typical clubs like The GSA, Chess Club, The Campus (campus newspaper)  to the weird and wacky like Knitting Club, Dumbledore's Army, etc. \n \nWe have many arts related programs and I know from experience that the music programs are involved, dedicated and fun to play in as an extracurricular activity. We play a variety of pieces and have two concerts a year. \n \nOne unique aspect about the college that is either positive or negative depending on your point of view is when you get there, you have to be your own advocate. There are many opportunities that the college can give you to succeed in your academic and professional life, but YOU have to do the work. This is not a college that will just present you with the answers, you are the one that has to go looking for them and provides the support instead of the answers to get there. This college will prepare you for graduate school or for any other higher learning institution because of our research opportunities and rigor of undergraduate work.  \n \nThe other unique aspect is, this is a college that has been in existence for over 200 years. When I was a freshman last year, submitting my deposit I knew I would be joining something bigger than myself. I would a apart of a 200 year community. Allegheny is a unit. That does not mean we are always a unit but that is what we strive to uphold. This may seem cliche but indeed, that is the truth. If you don\u2019t believe me? Come visit and see for yourself. \n \nAllegheny however,  is not a perfect college- what college is? Overall it deserves a five star rating because these are minimal complaints.\n \nThe food is good, but not amazing. I have certainly had my fair share of mushy vegetables, and under cooked meat I wouldn\u2019t touch with a ten foot pole. There are some really good options but again, it depends on the day. You have two options of food  being McKinleys and Brooks. Brooks is the place I talked about above, and McKinley's is another place that is consistent and in some cases, a better option but much less healthy food. \n \nThe dorms are rather nice with alot of variety to choose from. I would advise you to avoid the all freshman dorms because they can be rowdy and party-centric. \n \nThis school is small. Very small. If you are looking for a small interactive, tight knit community where you can get from place to place in about five minutes or less, this is indeed Allegheny. I have a love hate relationship with this because you will have to get off campus once in awhile to get a breather and you will see and know most people on campus. If I pass by someone I have never met before, I will probably see them about four more times before the day is finished. It can get tiresome but that means you have to adapt and find some nooks to hang out in. \n \nThat being said, the town Allegheny is in, is also, very small. Small college and small town. The town is called Meadville. People are nice and the college is very connected with the town, we are rather interlaced together in the middle of nowhere. We rely on the town as much as Meadville relies on us. This makes for a sweet small town community involved feel but can be rather suffocating if you do not know how to handle it. This can be a positive or negative aspect. City dwellers beware!\n \nIn conclusion,\n \nIf you are looking for a small Liberal Arts college that has accessible and involved professors who challenge you to do more than your best, that prepares you for graduate school through research opportunities and academic rigor, and a 200 year community that makes you want to give back- come to Allegheny!\n \nThank you for reading such a long review and I hope it was helpful in your college search!\n \n \n \n \n \n"

There are a multitude of clubs and activities\u2013 ranging from the outing club to the computer science club.  One unique opportunity that students have is the ability to volunteer at the coffee shop on campus!  There are also several ways to get involved with the Meadville community, such as through service events like the monthly Service Saturdays.  Although the city of Meadville is fairly small, there are still plenty of activities to do off of campus; My favorite being the movie theatre!  \n\nAs far as academics go, the education is very rigorous and office hours are a must.  Professors are always willing to help, and all of them get to know their students because of the small class sizes (typically under 25). I would highly recommend Allegheny."

Professors are easily accessible and are very helpful during both class times and office hours. You get to know your professors and they know you, often times each and every student by their first name. Its nice to be in a small classroom environment where you know everyone around you."

                "Comment": "Allegheny College is one of the best small liberal arts colleges in Pennsylvania (west of the Allegheny Mountains). There are tons of clubs and opportunities to get involved in all kinds of things from playing with clay to tackling people in club sports. Sports are present on campus, but do not overshadow the student body and are more fun than work (although athletes work super hard to balance both). Academics are a priority here and students are always studying, but there's room for fun if one is able to manage their time wisely (which is what college is all about). Making friends is not a problem as people are open and a small coffee shop on campus facilitates all kinds of conversations as well as activities organized by a group of student leaders to bring the campus together. As a first year I can only recommend everything Allegheny has given me, and I cannot wait for the next semester. "

The cost is a bit high, but for the education and job opportunities to look forward to, it's completely worth every cent. The campus is beautiful, the people are amazing and friendly, and I couldn't have made a better relationship with the people I have met. I am on the track team as well, and that is the biggest and best decision I have made. It allows me to really focus on my academics because our coach really cares about our education and puts that  before anything. \n\nIf I were to recommend a college to any of my friends, Allegheny college is the way to go. I am more than happy with my decision of choosing Allegheny College. "

If you're looking for small class sizes and the ability to know everyone in your classes, this is the place for you. Most students as well as professors hold a very liberal mindset. This mindset is very prominent through the behaviors and overall feel on campus. Be prepared to seek out professors in order to learn the complete material. Many professors leave out information saying you must attend office hours in order to obtain the full information for the exams. "

I would write about how President McKinley once attended Allegheny and how Rosa Parks visited our chapel.\nBut I\u2019m not a history expert, I just love my school.\n\nI choose Allegheny College for the academic opportunities it offered that would prepare me for my future better than any of the other schools I liked. They had amazing scholarships that made my dream of a great college at a great price a reality. When I got to campus, though, it became so much more.\n\nAt Allegheny you can find a group of people who will become your best friends, whether they are similar to you or the complete opposite. The college is small, but the diverse population is exciting. With many international students and students from across the country, I am always meeting new people who have experiences so vastly different from my own. At Allegheny, the dining hall employees know students by name, and they will always take the time to talk to you. Students in sports, fraternities and sororities, arts, and political organizations mix freely, without judgement. At Allegheny professors will email you if you aren\u2019t in class for a couple days because they want to make sure everything is alright. I know that this school will prepare me for my plans after college, and the friendships I have made here will last forever. At Allegheny, I found a home."

                "Comment": "I went to Allegheny for 2 and 1/2 years. I went because to Allegheny mostly because they offered me the best scholarship deal.  I did visit the campus for 2 days before I attended and I you don't really realize how desolate Meadville is until you have been there for a few months. It is hard to not be over the moon excited with being a Freshman and moving away to college and I think that gave me rose tinted glasses on my early impressions of the school and location. Once I got over that after a few months or the first year I was pretty unhappy with Allegheny. \n\nFor starters you are almost 2 hours from any city in what is almost Amish country. And if you come from a major city like NY, LA, SF etc neither Cleveland or Pittsburgh is going to be very inspiring as they are not even in the top 50 cities in the US by size. So not only were the cities far away but I found them disappointing as far as cities went and little reason to make the drive than get to the airport. The surroundings, particularity, Meadville, just started to depress me after awhile. There is just nothing to do. Not even a decent mountain anywhere nearby to make use of all the snow for skiing or boarding.  And there will be hell of a lot of snow starting early November usually. \n\nIf you like hard academics the school does have that. But since I wanted to transfer it was basically hell for me because getting a good GPA here is difficult which made transferring difficult. And it isn't like the school has the kind of reputation that the GPA carries any weight anyway. I ended up ditching Allegheny and got straight As at an easy community college so I could transfer to a school better than Allegheny. Allegheny wasn't only terrible but trapped me there and their terrible courses allowed me to transfer relatively few credits to me new school. That said, I think part of the reason it is hard is that many teachers are poor. Being a hard teacher does not make you a good teacher and I have had vastly better teachers overall since I left. I don't imagine Allegheny's location in the boonies helps them attract top talent. Many did not seem like happy people either compared to my later professors. \n\nOne of the good things about I can comment on is the general openness of the social scene. The school is not that big and since there is nothing nearby to do people let anyone and everyone into their parties and are friendly. The social scene isn't big enough to turn people away which is a nice change compared to what you'd find at a lot of big party schools. I felt the only way to not be bored to tears at the school was to join a fraternity; which I did. That said a lot of people get really drunk and take drugs since there is so little to do anywhere nearby and you can only party with the same people in the same place so many times before drugs start to look really fun. It is really hard to find a balance at Allegheny being trapped inside by the cold for over half the school year, and nothing to do when bored anyway. Lots of people slip into bad habits easily as a result. \n\nI have to comment the administration of the school also struck me as especially terrible. If you are ok being kinda in a depressing middle of nowhere small school that is way more difficult academically than its reputation really justifies with sub par teachers then Allegheny is the school for you. It certainly was not for me and I have to say going here is one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my life. "

I am a Neuroscience and Music double major with a minor in Latin. Allegheny has a great reputation for it's science program and now that i'm here on campus and in the classes I see why. The music program isn't as well known, but is still spectacular. It often gets cast aside though because people want to concentrate on other majors here with music just being there minor or distribution. It's nice though because you don't even have to be a music major or minor to audition for ensembles. I often go to office hours for help with work or just to study with some extra help. The professors are great! The school does require a lot academically but it's completely managable. You have plenty of time to pick what you want to do with your life because you don't even have to declare a major or minor until the end of your sophomore year.

                "Emily": "The academics here are wonderful.  I have been to two other institutions and Allegheny is by far the most challenging and the most rewarding.  Though the workload is really stressful, a lot of students have a hard time adjusting sophomore year when it really picks up, in the end it's worth it because the students graduate with the type enough knowledge to compete on the job market.  Class discussions in the humanities and social sciences are very common, and every student has to participate in seminars throughout their Allegheny carer to hone their academic skills.  Professors are very available, I have had them answer emails at one am and give out their personal cell numbers so that students can contact them with questions and concerns.  ",
                "Erika": "Allegheny definitely has a really heavy workload, but the student-teacher ratio is very manageable so over the last three years, I have really gotten to know most of my professors. Learning here is very student driven, as the curriculum allows us the flexibility to have a major and minor in two different fields of study, and take distribution classes in the third field of study (the fields are Humanities, Social Sciences, Life Sciences.) We even have the ability to create our own independent study courses and our own majors. I view my academic career as having limitless options. The most unique class I have taken thus far is a Neuroscience and Art class. ",
                "Abby": "Academics at Allegheny are tough. There really aren't any 'joke' or 'easy' classes, but that doesn't bother the students. The professors are supportive and reasonable. They also love student participation, and even lecture based classes with have discussion days. There is a good amount of homework, but professors tend to not assign busy work, so your homework never seems like a waste of time. The students are motivated, which means a lot of them like the challenge presented to them. \r\n   Because class size is usually around twenty students, it means the professors always know your name, and greet you when walking around campus. The professors attend the students shows and participate in different events. They were even judges for our annual Trashion show.\r\n   Allegheny doesn't have standard required classes, only a distribution requirement so you are able to take classes you want. The interdisciplinary classes are really fun because they tie together different departments, for example I'm taking history of neuroscience next semester which is co-taught between a history professor and a biology professor. \r\n  My favorite class right now is Environmental Literature because it is filled with English majors, Environmental Science/Studies major, and Biology majors. It results in a lot of debates over different perspectives. I have left that class still arguing points over with other students. ",
                "Daniel": "Small class sizes and very close relationships with professors are two things that come to mind when I think of academics. Academic buildings are even laid out with these principals in mind- there are study areas outside of every professors office and every professor has 6 scheduled \"office hours\" a week, making them very accessible. \r\n\r\nIntro chem (chem 110/ 112) are probably the largest classes on campus. My 110 class had at most 35- 40 students in it and was taught in a classroom, NOT a lecture hall.\r\n\r\nAllegheny is very unique because we have a seminar series that develops and culminates with a senior project or \"comp.\" \r\n\r\nAs a freshmen you take an FS 101 then 102 class. 101 and 102 are geared towards getting settled in school, making new friends and improving your writing and discussion skills. These are things that you will draw from for the next 3.5 years at Allegheny. You also get a peer leader- an upperclassmen associated with the class that helps guide you through your first semester. (I was never very close with mine because I made friends quickly, and being on a sports team I had a slew of peer leaders, but my non athlete friends really enjoyed theirs.) \r\n\r\nSoph year you take a FS201 that is within your major... lots of writing, research, speaking, presentation, etc, but it is within your major. \r\n\r\nJunior year is a junior sem which prepares you for your comp\r\n\r\nSenior year you work on your project. It is designed to mimic a masters or PhD thesis. In other words, you carry out your project and present it to a panel of professors (and sometimes pres Mullen!) \r\n\r\n\r\npoint is, Allegheny prepares students very well for excellence inside and outside of the classroom. We have extremely high acceptance rates to grad programs, and the seminar series is one of the reasons why. ",
                "Amy": "\"How was the game!?\" was a questioned asked to me by our President, Jim Mullen.  He knows my name. He remembered that I had just finished cheering for my first football game of the season.  I'm not just another student to him.  If this can be said about the president of the school, a man with 2,000 students and many more faculty and staff, I'm sure you can imagine how well our professors know us! Classes sizes are typically 13:1, although in my experience that number is high.  This has allowed for more discussion and a deeper understanding of what I'm learning. It makes me feel like they are teaching me so that I can be successful outside of these four years, not just for the sake of sharing their hard earned expertise with us for their own benefit.  I have been challenged and pushed past what I was sure was my limit. I'm capable of more than I thought I was. School is hard, there is no denying that. Allegheny gives us every tool to be successful. You will do as well as you choose to. "

            "What are the most popular student activities/groups?  ": {
                "Janelle": "Students of Allegheny are involved in a variety of things.  No student on this campus is not involved with at least two activities outside of class.  There is a club fair held every fall semester where students are able to sign up for clubs on and off campus.",
                "Danielle": "Allegheny has so much to offer, it is almost dizzying.  There is a club or organization for pretty much anything a student could be interested in.  There is community service, clubs for academics, athletics, and political groups.  If I am awake at 2am on a Tuesday night, I am most likely studying or working on homework.  Weekends are typically for activities, but there is always some type of event going on throughout the week.  Fraternities and sororities are important for a lot of people at Allegheny.  If drinking is not your cup of tea, Allegheny has Late Night Programs which are events that occur late at night on the weekends.  Off campus, there is not too much to do, but that is because I have lived in this area all my life.  You can go check out a movie, go out to eat, shop in Erie, Pa or at the Grove City outlets.  There are some great nature trails around, also. ",
                "Breana": "Allegheny has a huge variety of on campus organizations and activities. I wouldn't say one is more popular than another. I do know that Orchesis (a dance production) contains the most students every year. I am personally involved in a lot of music oriented activities and love them all. ",
                "Emily": "Greek life is probably the biggest presence on campus.  There is also a lot of involvement in sports, both varsity and intramural.  The drama department puts on three shows a year and there are also various student directed works throughout the fall and spring.  A lot of the students here do go out to parties on the weekend, but there is nearly always an event in the campus center on saturday nights for students that don't want to drink.  There are so many organizations here that it is very easy to get over-involved, this is the most common complaint I have heard about student life.  ",
                "Abby": "     On campus, there are over 100 student organizations. I am personally a member of Lambda Sigma Honor Society, Advocating Global Health and Development, and an officer in Students for Environmental Action, Edible Allegheny Campus, and A5 (Association for Asian and Asian American Awareness). My friends say I'm crazy, but most people are a member of at least one or two clubs or teams. \r\n    There is Greek life on campus (about 20ish%), but it is really open. I have a lot of friends who are Greek, even though I'm not. You also can't go Greek till second semester of your freshman year, which ensures that you make friends with people in your clubs, classes, and hallway. \r\n   There are parties on the weekends, but Allegheny is by no means a big party school. A lot of students participate in late night events on Friday and Saturday nights which range from tie-dying to make your own sushi. Gator Activity Programming brings in a lot of bands, comedians, dance groups, and even magicians for entertainment on campus. They also plan the big events like Wingfest, Homecoming, and Springfest. ",
                "Tabitha": "People support a the sports teams a lot because you always know at least one person on each team. Gator Activities Programming (GAP), Allegheny Student Government (ASG), and intramurals are probably the other most popular groups. There is always something going on on campus- you are never bored- whether it is a comedian, a student production, a sporting event, or other events. The one dining hall also stays open pretty late so that is a popular hang out. There are usually parties every weekend somewhere- you just might have to go hunt them out to find them. There are several local bars that are fun (once you are 21!!) Every year, homecoming and Springfest (annual spring party on campus) are the two most popular events. ",
                "Daniel": "\r\nAllegheny students are involved in anything and everything. If there isn't something you want, students make their own groups all the time. Student government (ASG) and Gator Activity Programing (GAP) are dominant. My theory is since we have a strong poly sci department, alot of those kids get involved in these types of activities. \r\n\r\nWe have Greeklife as well, but it is as much as you want to make it. There are some guys and girls who are really into it, others that although are in, do not do much for it, and further others who are not in it and want nothing to do with it. If you want to do it, you are more then welcome to, but there is no overall social pressure to accept or decline your bid. \r\n\r\nThe school does a good job announcing many non-alcoholic activities as well. There is always something happening at the campus center on weekends and some weeknights as well. These activities range from music department concerts, arts and crafts, comedians, movies and most recently make your own sushi bars and paintball!",
                "Amy": "Most, if not all Allegheny students are involved in more than a few student organizations.  The most popular student organizations are Allegheny Student Government, Gator Activities Programming, Alpha Phi Omega Service Fraternity, traditional greek life, and sports teams, both intramural and varsity."

            "What is your overall opinion of this school? ": {
                "Janelle": "While the school may be quite a drive from Pittsburgh it still has a Pittsburgh feeling to it due to the fact a large portion of the school is from the area.  There is a growing number of students who originate from outside Pittsburgh and even the state of Pennsylvania.  The campus promotes students to be involved on and off campus and gives students plenty of opportunities to do so.  The classes are difficult but not impossible but the course work is intense (not to say that students do not have fun at Allegheny).  \"Work hard, play hard\" is a part of the Allegheny culture and many students learn not to get the two confused.  There are only two places to eat on campus but students tend to go to local restaurants to supplement the lack of places to eat on campus.  The best part about Allegheny College is they prepare their students for the real world.  From freshman seminars to a senior project, students at Allegheny learn how to speak in public and even write dissertations.  This small school may not be for some but others will find it a perfect fit.   ",
                "Breana": "I would have to say what I really love about Allegheny are the professors. It's amazing to see how excited they get while teaching you something they love. They are also willing to help you with work whenever you need it and are willing to explain material in a variety of ways. If I could change one thing about the campus, I would change the weather. It rains quite a bit here. The school is a smaller school (2,100) but I feel it's just right. You get to know people really well. Anytime I tell people I go to Allegheny I always get positive responses. I spend most of my time on campus in the campus center. It's a building that contains the schools auditorium, music hall, art hall, food court, post office, coffee shop, book store, and student activities offices. It's a great place to hang out. There's always something going on in there. The town itself is pretty small. There's no problem getting to a Walmart or local store to get anything you need. Plus there are many local dining choices along with your common chain restaurants. We're in the same county that holds the largest agricultural fair in Pennsylvania every year so if you ever want to have fresh grown vegetables or homemade jam and peanut butter then you're in luck. Additionally, the maple syrup made in this area is to die for. i love the faculty here. Everyone always tries to make life easier for you so that you can concentrate on on what really matters and not have to be stressed about everything going on thoughout the campus behind the scenes. Often times the administrators have more school spirit than the students. I can't really recall any huge controversies but I think at one point this semester someone wrote something innappropriate on one of the campus building in chalk. There is a lot of school pride. Everyone here is really glad to be a part of the school. Everything about this school is unusual. If you wanted you could even design your own major. Additionally we are an extremely \"green\" campus. We really focus on recycling and saving evergy. I will never forget my performance of the Putnam County Spelling Bee! The theatre department even made a four foot by six foot head shot of me and hung it up in the window of the theatre building. Students often complain about the weather and the cost of tuition. I'm from the area so I'm use to the weather and the cost isn't always that much. Allegheny really helps students in need. My tuition was initially around a little less than 50,000 and I'm only paying about 4,000 for this year (that's with loans)! However that does includ all of the scholarships I earned on my own as well. My point is though, if you work hard you can come here and not go completely broke.",
                "Julia": "Allegheny College's mission to promote an engaging atmosphere of discussion is reflected in its policies, faculty, and offerings.  While Allegheny students are provided guidance in order to develop, the institution values the autonomy of its students to understand their expectations for their education and to pursue those expectations.  The process of the anticipated Senior Project largely reflects this practice.  While students are provided with the college's structure and faculty guidance to assist in completing this graduation requirement, both respect the ideas and potential of the student to produce meaningful academic work.    \r\n\r\n",
                "Emily": "This is a community.  It's a small school and you are going to at least recognize most people on campus by your second semester here.  It is really easy to get involved, there is a lot of support for new groups and organizations.  President Mullen makes it a point to be involved in student life, he often walks around campus to chat with students in warm weather.  The education here is unparalleled, in all my years here I have only ever had one professor who didn't live up to the Allegheny standards and the issue was resolved as soon as I took it to the chair of the department.  The most often heard complaints are the food (which is decent but not gourmet by any standard) and the housing situations; while the new dorms are really nice there are still not enough rooms to house all the students with a new four year residency plan on the horizon. I would not suggest coming here if you want the big university vibe, because that is not what you will get here.  The upside is professors who know you by name and take a personal interest in you as a student and a person. ",
                "Erika": "The size of Allegheny College is perfect. I don't feel that the school is limiting because of its size. The fact that we only have undergraduates makes it easy to get involved in so many great opportunities and small class sizes makes it so easy to get to know your professors. I like that our school is connected to the Meadville community and I still think the small town provides students with great volunteer opportunities as well as jobs an internships.  ",
                "Abby": "  I came to Allegheny because when I could see myself living there for the next four years. \r\n   Allegheny College is a small college, its possible to walk around the entire edge of campus in a half hour at a nice leisurely. It many be small, but campus never feels claustrophobic. It is filled with trees, lawns, and beautiful brick walks. It also means that if you wake up ten minutes before class, you can still make it on time. \r\n   The professors and administrators are really nice and most of them live near campus so you see them around town and about campus. The teacher band Credit/No Credit rocks out occasionally at Grounds for Change (campus coffee shop). \r\n   Meadville is not your typical college town, but it has a cheap movie theater with special deals, plenty of thrift stores, and a lot of great shops and restaurants like @ The Bank, Tattered Corners, the Market House, Creative Crust, and Mickeys. There is a good relationship between the college and the town, which was important to me when looking at schools. \r\n   Overall, I love Allegheny, because it is as much a college as it is a community. \r\n   ",
                "Tabitha": "The best thing about Allegheny for me has been the activities I have been involved in and the friends I have met here. Also, the professors are amazing- they are all very kind and really want to teach and be there for their students- some even give out their home phone numbers! For me, Allegheny is the right size because you can be anonymous, but you are never just a number to professors of the administration. Most people in PA know about Allegheny, but few people outside PA have heard of it unless they are Alum. I spend a lot of time in academic buildings- doing homework or studying! The buildings and campus in general is pretty well maintained. Meadville is nice, but it is a small town- no mall, no starbucks- but we do have a lot of great family owned places! The administration has angered me some during my time because of some small instances and their lack of response to things, but I suppose they do their best. Our president is a great guy though- very friendly! Allegheny has been great and I will miss it immensely when I leave, but it does have its down sides- only as you spend more time here do those become apparent. ",
                "Amy": "I am absolutely in love with Allegheny.  I don't know if it is the beautiful campus, the community setting, the student-professor relationships, or the knowledge that it was this school that taught me that any combination of my passions can be combined to make my dream job a reality. Allegheny's campus is small, but not too small.  In my four years at Allegheny I have met a lot of wonderful people; there is always a warm, familiar face to greet you as you walk to class. Thankfully, there is also always someone new to meet, including professors. The professors at Allegheny not just educators- they are mentors and friends. Forming professional relationships where I am challenged intellectually and personally with my professors has helped to complete the sense of community I feel at Allegheny.  This makes all the difference. "

What do you want to do for the rest of your life?  Will you need further schooling to do that?  Are you financially prepared for the amount of school you need?   What are your long and short-term goals, and how will you get there?  Will you still feel the same in 10-15 years?  How will your current decisions effect your future family?

In college I thought it would be the same way, but it wasn't and my pride sometimes holds me back from asking questions. I would also tell myself to be ready to start from square one.

The first year, especially the first semester, will be stressful and you may experience some difficulties transitioning into the new culture away from friends and family, but do not fret. You will eventually develop a close group of friends, and you should look forward to many random adventures around town. Meadville may seem too small and boring at first glance, but give it a chance and you will come to appreciate its little perks over time.

I would tell my younger self to trust in my abilities, which have gotten me far already -- no minor accomplishment -- and which can be relied upon in the years to come.  On the other hand, I could not have guessed at the time that college would be so much more intense than high school.  I didn't expect to be writing those late-night essays with such frequency!

Along with the workload, adjusting to being away from home did take it's toll. I think the best advice to give any high school student about college is that it is a change from what you are used to. You have to keep an open mind, work hard but still remember to have fun. After all, that is what life is truly all about, not just college.",
                "Alex": "The biggest piece of advice that I would give myself as a high school senior is to explore everything and not be afraid of the unknown.  Making the transition to college can be intimidating as I found out firsthand.  However, as I explored the unknown and met new people I found my fear disappearing.  Getting out of your confort zone can be scary at first, but in the end it will allow you to experience things that you could never imagine before.\n\nMore specifically, I would tell myself to sign up for more clubs and activities.  Meeting people that share even a single common interest can help to build the new circle of friends that you'll want to have in college.  In addition, any form of motivation to leave the comfort of your dorm room for mysteries of the unknown is always positive.  College is a time of exploration, it's best to take full advantage of this while you're here and not let your fears hold you back.  You have nothing to fear but your finals, and even those aren't too bad.",
                "Kimberly": "Try hard until the end. Do not quit trying once you get accepted into college.  That break will cause more difficulties adjusting to the workload in college.  Even if it is hard to give it your best effort until graduation you need to do it so that you keep up the momentum you had that got you into such a great school.  That great school will have no sympathy for that fact that you have not done any type of school work in six months and when you get there they will pile on the work to you just as they will to a student who prepared for college all summer.  Keep up with your work, the topics that can be related to other things may be unknown until you get into a situation where if you knew them you would be one step ahead.  Give it your best efforty because starting one step ahead can get you along much easier that trying to start three steps behind and having to relearn topics.  Give all of your work the best effort you have, it will pay off in the end.",

Struggling with getting a job and making ends meet, moving half way across the country, all while trying to get a GED. You worked hard, though, and you acheived your dream of six years. It made you learn one of the most important things: Perserverance. You may have felt down when people criticized you or looked down upon you, discouraged you even. I wish you would have learned to scoff at them sooner, because you ended up proving yourself right.  You're now onto the next step of your goal. College is going to be strenuous, especially with all of the activities and classes you'll like to take. Remember how you proved yourself, dropping out and getting a GED, making your own way in this world, and saying \"Yes, I can and will.\" You'll need that same perserverance that got you through the time you had in high school to get you through college. I know you can do it though. You're acheiving great things now, Younger Self. Don't ever let anyone tell you you can only do otherwise.",

Just be wise and understand that it's your future and nothing should stop you from what you want to become. Nevertheless, choose what you want as a career that you would be happy with until you retire and listen your heart rather than other people.

If you know you are not doing well in the class just drop it, don't be a shame and do not fear the unknown. After highschool life is different your actions and choices have consequences. Money is going to be an issues and contact financial aid, scholarship programs as soon as possible. Complete all of the scholarship forms you have filled out, you will need it. You will over pack and buy more stuff write your name on everything. Remember not everyone in new York is going to remain your friend, not everyone you meet in college will be your friend, people come and go, that is jsut a part of life. Do not fear Allegheny will be the home away from home you think it will be. Work hard not your family, but for yourself.",

Trace Adkins sings ever true lyrics, for here I am a senior in college, while I still feel like I just graduated from high school.  Do not take any moment for granted, because when you put off studying for a day and sometimes even an hour it will affect your life.  Friends and family will go away, and some will stay, but it is up to you how your future turns out. Please call home more often then necessary, for it will help you navigate your new life.  Your parents will help you always, even if it is 200 miles away.  Don't give in to peer pressure, be a strong woman, and stand up for yourself.  Do not talk yourself out of your ideas or goals, like when you want to run for student government or don't understand why you recieved a grade.  Put in the extra effort  because so many opportunites await for you to grow, discover, love, and have fun.",
                "Elyssa": "In my view, the most important advice for myself would have been to take a foreign language for more than 2 years.  I took Spanish for 2 years in high school and after seeing how many people were already well prepared to continue on with it in college makes me regret not taking more years of it.  The beginner classes at Allegheny focus on speaking the language fluently, which is why I feel that I would be at a disadvantage if I started taking a Spanish class now.  High school prepared the students for what to expect in a foreign language class and I wish I could have been a part of that.  There are college owned dorms (for example the Spanish house and French house) with allow students to connect with one another on a deeper level aside from having the their own foreign language club on campus.  The foreign language programs offered are extremely beneficial if a student is interested in going to a foreign country to study abroad.  If only I would have taken a foreign language more seriously in high school, many more opportunities could have come my way in college like the ones listed above.",

If I could go back and talk to myself as a high school senior, I would have a few words of wisdom to share. I would emphasize the importance of being friendly and social while maintaining perspective on my studies. I now know that time management is a completely different skill in college than it is in high school. When it comes to schoolwork, it is necessary to establish a routine and to find a place to study that is free of distractions. My biggest regret of first semester is not making efficient use of my time, especially when it came to studying. I have since realized how important it is to manage my schoolwork, and how to set goals in order to measure my progress.\nI would also remind myself to keep an open mind. I made friends with people last year who are very different from me, and it taught me volumes about accepting others. Prior to these experiences, I may have been judgmental of people who could have ended up being great friends.",
                "Jessica": "Assuming that I could go back in time and talk to myself as a high school senior I have a lot of advice that I would give myself.  Mainly, I would tell myself, or any other senior for that matter, to go into college with an open mind.  Everyone is different in college, people have different backgrounds and cultures and will simply be altogether different from you; take this opportunity and get to know these people and broaden your horizons.  I would also keep an open mind about my academic goals.  The transition to college is hard and it is important to know that.  It is also important to note that the level of difficulty may force you to change your major and this may be a harsh reality to face, but you will be much happier in the end and you will exceed to your highest potential if you simply take the leap and follow your heart.  Lastly, keep an open mind about opportunities that may arise for you.  Take every single one of them; not only will they build your resume, they will build your character.",

Really things to make the financial responsibilities a bit less stressful, I think I did everything else right.",

I listened to my parents' desires and chose a school I liked, but most definitely do not love.  I would also tell myself that anything is possible, and to keep dreaming.  Although choosing a college narrows your options, that doesn't mean dreaming has to end.  Additionally, I would tell myself to be less shy, and open up more during orientation.",
                "Kiah": "Graduation.  Prom.  Senior trip. There are so many exhilarating memories associated with my senior year.  I can\u2019t think of a single experience that I would have changed.  Almost all of my classes were Advanced Placement classes and I worked hard to get good grades so that I would be able to get into the college of my choice. I also spent time with friends and loved ones and enjoyed my free time.  If I had to go back into the past and help myself change an aspect of my senior year, I would tell myself to get more information about the financial aspects of college.  I would have asked more questions and gathered more facts about all of the different loans and scholarships that were available.  Working with numbers has never been a strong suit of mine, but I wish I could have worked harder to educate myself about finances that are associated with college.",

I has taught me to work hard and to understand that nothing is impossible.  Seeing that there is always a way to be better and to help others in their lives inspires me to push forward.  My expectations for myself has increased 10 fold.  So I now see that even though nothing was ever handed to me, I can still make it in America and be a upstanding citizen.  I have seen people who's education take them to new things and they come back to thier schools and inspire students to advance themselves.  Coming to college has given me the motivation to face the world and be a better person. The college experience is very valuable because it showed me how to be diverse and understand the differences in being a child grown into an adult.  Now I feel as if i have the tools i need to face the tribulations of life and always come out with my head held high and enough strength to face the next day.  College has been a true great inspiration.",
                "Lauren ": "So far, my college experience has been an exciting, innovating, eye-opening, and suprising one. In my first semester here at Allegheny College, I have learned how to be on my own, set my own rules, take care of myself, and basically live my own life. It has taught me to manage my own time in both an academic and personal sense; something that I had a problem with in high school. However, college is not just about books and papers and studying. It is about living.  Of course it is important to do your best in and out of class, after all, that is the whole reason that I came to college,  to learn neuroscience / pre-med in order to prepare for medical school and my career as a neurologist. Still, that is not what it is all about.  This is the reason that my undergraduate college experience has been so valuable, it has taught me to appreciate the little things in life; the things that I took for granted in high school.  After all, it is the moments among friends and family that make life worth living. And, for this lesson, I am truly grateful.",
                "Joshua ": "Although I am only a single semester into my freshman year, I have gotten so much out of Allegheny College. I have taken advantage of many opportunities that the school offers and that is not even the half of it. My advisor, as well as other professors I have gtten to know, have taught me much more than the required course materials. They have taught me to get involved and do not be afraid to let my voice be heard. I have taken classes that I absolutely loved and that have swayed me towards various majrs and minors. There is an immense amount of opportunities that Allegheny College offers and I will continue to take advantage of them throughout the rest of my educational career.",
                "Shane ": "What have I gotten from my college experience?  An identity.  Studying at Allegheny College has defined who I am as an individual, a scholar, and a global citizen of the world.  Before attending college I thought I knew what I wanted from life \u2013I had a career plan.  Studying at Allegheny College, however, has taught me that having passion for what I do, not just a plan, will provide me with the life I want to live.   I cannot even begin to describe the growth I have experienced at Allegheny. In my first year of college I successfully broke free of the chains that held me down during high school.  I blossomed into a student leader, an advocate for social change, and a committed community member.  I do not like to think about my life without Allegheny College.  Doing so makes me think of the person I would have failed to become.   So yes, I have gained an identity, a better understanding for who I am as a human being and what I want from life.   Never before would I have imagined that I would be as prepared as I am to step into the \u201creal world\u201d.",
                "Briana ": "The college experience has taught me about freedom to d what you want while keeping up with the bills and time managment. You do not have your parents reminding you about projects or appointments. It is all on your shoulders now and you need to work out a system that works for you so that you can stay organized and punctual. College is a great way to meet new people and of course follow your dreams of a higher education.",
                "Anne ": "At Allegheny College, I have become part of a tolerant community which has allowed me to experiment socially with whom I want to be - I have been able to participate in student theatre groups, a sorority, and choral groups and have been able to maintain friendships with everyone - no one has judged me at all.  I have found people who enjoy classes as much as I do - my best friends and I talk about Shakespeare and Jane Austen all the time, and we have Costume Drama Film parties every two weeks.  I have learned to juggle academics and a social life by being vice president of my sorority while taking three upper division seminars, but all my professors were so supportive that the extra workload was not a stretch.  Allegheny has been a place where I have been able to grow up and mature and I am so proud to be a student there.",
                "Amanda ": "I have gotten so much out of my college experience, even though a lot of it has been from bad experiences. I have learned that you really have to fight to get what you want, and to have people behind what you're fighting for no matter what. You always have to work really hard to get what you want, and that you have to learn to change yourself now to be prepared for the workplace before you graduate.",

All of friends were going to college and I did not want to be left out, I guess you could say I was a follower. After starting and experiencing college, I realized just how important it was. I strive to achieve my best,  and turned into a leader. I joined SGA and that organization made a impact on my outlook. Before, I had just been attending college. After I joined, I was attending college and being apart of the whole experience. I wish to graduate from Gadsden State, and then transfer to further my degree and follow my dreams of becoming a first grade teacher. Attending college is the only way I can reach that dream, so attending is very important.",
                "Kelsey ": "Allegheny College is a school where a person can sit in a class and learn without worrieing about what others think about them.  It is a school where teachers are always avalible and willing to help you with materials or even life problems that you may be struggling with.  Attending a small College has been the best experiance ever.  You are constantly surrounded by a circle of friends that is constantly growing as the year goes bye.  Allegheny teaches their students that life is hard enough as it is, people don't need to deal with the additions of unkind faces constantly degrading them.  Instead Allegheny College promotes smiling and saying high to strangers.  What I have learned is that when you make someones day you end up feeling better about your own",
                "Richard ": "Changing anything about the transition to college would mean changing the very experience necessary to go on with life.  College teaches you the value of a dollar.  By instantly throwing students into a mound of debt with loans, students have to quickly adapt and start saving money.  Suddenly a world of wants is transformed into a world of needs and every person learns how to save and spend carefully.  The limited size of dorm rooms forces students to pack necessities; not everything in their room is going to fit, especially since its being shared.  Students will have to be nit-picky about what they take.   Large televisions and oversized beds are going to have to stay home, while laptops, books, and some pictures can be taken.  Going to college is a re-birthing of sorts.  It is the modern day coming of age.  Instead of having to hunt like the Native Americans, students have to survive in an urban wilderness.  By changing any facet of this experience students are limited in their potential to grow and thus their ability to survive as an adult.",
                "Catherine ": "If I could go back and talk to myself as a high school senior I would tell myself that the transition to college is a struggle. It is not the way movies, books, and college advertisements make it seem. Classes will be difficult, finding real friends takes time, and parties are not the way they are portrayed on tv. There will be lonely nights and stress filled nights, but by the end of your transition to college you will have built your character tremendously. Mistakes are ok, and even necessary in the transition process. Realizing there are consequences to every action is an important part of growing up, and a crucial part in the transition to college. Without parents around to monitor you, waking up on time, studying, being careful at parties, and balancing a social life with school work is your own responsibility. This is really a life changing experience and although its difficult in the beginning, it prepares you for life and I wouldn't trade it for the world.",

                "Leigh ": "In high school, I believed that I was liberal, but really I was conservative and narrow-minded.  I have my own way of accomplishing tasks, and strongly believed everyone else should follow my lead.  When I went to Allegheny, many of my friends thrived by working under pressure.  For them, writing an entire paper hours before its due date produces their best work.  At first, this was hard for me to accept, and I attempted to change their personal style.  But as my first semester progressed, I realized that I cannot control those around me, nor can I ask them to conform to my wishes.  Every person must deal with their own decisions and work ethic, and I cannot decree to them how I feel they should work and act.  By accepting this truth, I realized how much I had distanced myself while I was in high school.  No one wants to be friends with someone who attempts to change them.  So my advice to my senior self would be, \" Relax, and accept others for who they are.\"  I lost time attempting to change my friends, insteading of learning to tolerate and learn from them.",

Being that I'm only 17, living on my own with rent and bills and already attending college full time for dentistry and have a full time job at a dentists office as well as a part time job at a grocery store, I believe that if I went back to speak to myself maybe I would listen. Hearing how important school is and how much adult life isn't as great as it seems from someone 40 years old seems hard to realate to but hearing yourself just a month out of high school may hit a little harder. I would tell myself to spend the extra 10 minutes checking those answers on the homework and work harder at finding financial aid because working to pay bills and going to school at the same time is much harder then I think. I would remind myself to always look to the future because regardless of where I've been, its where and who I push myself to be in the future that matters.",

These people give you advice from what they have experienced and what they have seen, but no one can tell you what is truly in your head or your heart except yourself.  Manipulating your choices according to someone else's plan may seem simple at first, but ultimately you will not be satisfied with what your life has become.  It may cause tension and strained or even broken relationships; not everything will work out the way you thought or hoped, but you can and will get through. There will be people who will support you no matter what road you eventually choose, or the paths you take to get there.  And the result will be a life that surpasses what you ever thought was possible.",

Colleges look at your GPA. Good grades allow for a high GPA. Second, All those honors classes you took throughout high school are great. They really prepare you for whats ahead. Teachers push you to get a feeling for the college life. College is great and you will love it.  You will make plenty of friends and have a lot of on-campus activities to join.

I personally made a lot of mistakes and would love to go back to that time with the knowledge I have to re-do everything. My first mistake as an applicant was believing all the hype of college applications, becoming obsessed with the process, and giving into the uneccesary stress. I should have stuck to the mantra, you will get into a college and you will be happy. Also, I should have eliminated some of the excess extracarriculars I packed into my first semester which were incredibly distracting and forced my focus on entrance essays to come in second.  I should have also made sure that I would be happy at each school that I applied to. I didn't. Instead, I just chose a few random safties that I hated \"just in case.\"  I would have forced myself to start the process at the beginning of my Junior year rather than mid-way through it.  Lastly, I would have told myself to be a bit more open-minded, becuase even very unattractive schools can have hidden pleasant surprises.",
                "Sarah ": "My advice that I would give myself would be to study as much as you possibly could for chemistry and math because those are very difficult classes. Continuing on the school subject, I would tell myself to get a tutor before classes start even if you dont need one, just in case.  I would also tell myself to try to get connected with volunteering and christian organizations. These are some programs that you could put on medical school applications, and you could be giving to the community, meeting great poeple as a result of a giving attitude. Speaking of attitudes, keep a positive one. Tell yourself you can even when others around you say the opposite. Believe that you can overcome anything as long as you are doing it to better yourself.  In addition to those few things, knowing myself the way I do, do not get more involved in a social life than in your studies. You are there for and education, and you can not get your Ph.D. in popularity even though you would if it was a major. Study hard and keep your eye on the prize!"

They are Natural Sciences, Humanities, and Social Sciences. You major in one, minor in another, and take at least 8 credits worth in the third. Having this curriculum set up makes it impossible to not be well rounded. I'm double majoring in Neuroscience and Music with a minor in Latin. I don't think I would have been able to do this successfully at any other school. Our motto is \"unusual combinations\" and it fits our school perfectly.\r\n\r\nSmall- Allegheny may be a small school but in my opinion that's not a bad thing. It's helped me to meet more people and to get more involved in a variety of activities on campus.\r\n\r\nParty School- There are quite a few parties on campus here. However, if it's not your scene it's completely avoidable. Nothing about the campus has ever made me feel unsafe or pressured into doing something I don't want to or to try to be something I'm not.

                "Julia": "The typical Allegheny student has been categorized as scholastically ambitious.  The Allegheny student is driven to select courses that relate to his or her academic and future professional interests.  While the Allegheny student may have a larger and more difficult course load than a typical college student, this is understood to be driven by a desire to develop in understanding and experience.",
                "Emily": "We can be seen as a semi-preppy school for kids from the Pittsburgh area, and to some extent this is true. However, our motto is \"unusual combinations\" and this is a pretty good way to describe the student body.  The students here are multidimensional, we are unique in that we celebrate the bizarre.  Among my friends I have one that plays the bagpipes, another who practices fire-dancing, and I know several guys who are minoring in ballroom.  Though a lot of the students do come from out of state, most stay on campus on the weekends.  I am personally 900 miles away from home, and I have never had a problem fitting in to this community (except during football season, Steelers fans are brutal.)",
                "Erika": "I think that our students do not fit into a certain stereotype. Since students here are involved in so many differing academic fields and activities, it is so easy to get to know people from different stereotypical \"groups.\"",

Because everyone is interested in an array of topics you end up with frat guys who host evening meditations and theater geeks who write plays about environmental justice topics. The one true stereotype of Allegheny students is that they never have free time, because they are always participating in something!",
                "Tabitha": "I come from a small town in rural PA, so to me a lot of the kids are very wealthy and slightly snobby. They calm down after a year or two and start to appreciate the diversity which Allegheny has. There is a large population from Pittsburgh and PA in general- also OH, MD, NY, and the northeast in general are well represented; but Allegheny does have students from over 30 states and many different countries. The longer you are there the more diveristy you learn about. Cliques do form obviously, but it is not so bad that anyone feels completely left out- it can take a while to find your niche though. In general, we are all pretty hard working and driven. There are a lot of type A personalities on campus which can get pretty overwhelming. ",
                "Daniel": "It is difficult to place a stereotype on Allegheny students because there is really a place for everyone at the school. However, it is much easier to apply certain traits to the student body. Words like \"committed\" \"well rounded\" \"hardworking\" \"involved,\" and \"friendly\" characterize most of students I interact with on a daily basis, but also the student body as a whole. Within the student body, there are some stereotypes present. Although the campus as a whole is not super preppy, you will find some, usually involved in Greek life. There are some jockey kids as well who are usually associated with their sports team of choice. Additionally, we have our fair share of nerdy kids and the weird/ awkward types. Point is, we have just about everyone here so no matter who you are, you'll be able to find someone you can relate to.",
                "Amy": "Typically, Allegheny students are the kids who did almost nothing to get good grades in high school. We went to class, kind of took notes, and breezed through. Our stereotype: nerds. Maybe this is a little bit true. We do well school, it makes sense to us, academia is well within the walls of our comfort zone.  Allegheny, however, challenges that. We are pushed to do more, to study harder, and challenges our security in the \"overly-intelligent\" nerd role.  Going to class and kind of taking notes isn't enough anymore. Allegheny students learn to work.  We very quickly transform from nerds to nerds with some serious work ethic. Thank you Allegheny, for that."

My favorite professor took me and seventeen other students to England to study theatre last summer, and while we were there, we discovered that he is one of the most renowned professors in his field (all the academics in England knew him).  Other professors loan me their personal books and have invited me to dinner at their homes.

I have gotten and increased self-esteem because I have accomplished more than I ever thought was possible just by attending college and making good grades when it would be easier to make excuses on why I can't do it. \nIt has been extremely valuable to me not just because my education will increase my earning potential but also because it shows my daughter that a woman can be smart and a woman is allowed to have other ambitions than to be a wife and mother even if she already is. Most importantly it has been valuable because I have learned that more tolerance for others by being exposed to different lifestyles, religions, races, and creeds and even if I didn't finnish my degree the fact that I learned tolerance for others is enough to make the world a better place.",
                "Morgan ": "I have grown immensely as a person just in my first months of schooling at Allen College.  In my Radiography program, we start clinical rotations at hospitals and clinics in the first month of schooling.  When I began clinicals, I was timid, did not know a lot about patient care or how to communicate with patients, and plainly had a lot of growing in my profession to do.  Even though it has only been a few months, I am glad Allen puts us straight into the clinical/working environment.  What better way to learn your profession than to actually do it.  Between the clinicals and classroom learning, I have learned and grown far more in a short period of time than I thought was possible.  The classroom instructors and clinical coordinators have helped to shape me into a professional in a short period of time, and over the next year and a half, I can only grow more.",
                "Jacqueline ": "When it comes to college experience I've gotten so much out of it that its been so useful to me. When it comes to college you get to make your own schedule that fit your own daily schedule. For example, if you have any children and you work during the morining you can make your school schedule to have classes at night. Also, when it comes to college experience you can see here that you are responsible for attending your classes, buying your own books, even having to pay for your own classes. College experience has influence many people to take charge of their responsibilities and how to manage their time when it comes to school, working, and taking care of your kids. College is very valuable to attend because you do not want to be working in the same jobs 5 years from now. In life you want better for yourself and for your family. I know that later on in life I would want a great job and to be able to provide for my family on my own with the help of my husband later on life.",
                "Anna ": "College has been a stressful time, but it's also been a lot of fun and a great experience so far. Although there is a lot of work that we have to do and a lot of hard tests, I feel as though I've already learned so much and it's making me really excited to be a nurse. I also feel like the college experience has allowed me to meet many great friends. I started off going to this school without knowing a single person, but I feel as though I've met a lot of great people that I will remain friends with for life. Allen College has also allowed me to continue my love for singing. The school doesn't offer a lot of extracurricular activities due to the fact that it's small, but they do have a choir. The choir consists of students from all of the different classes, as well as teachers and faculty from the hospital our school affiliates with. It's a great way to meet people and get to know the faculty. Overall, Allen College is a great school and is a great experience both socially and academically."

College is just one of those things that have to be experienced because college has so many unpredictable factors.  There are a lot of factors that go along with going to college, and most individuals don?t even think about them before setting foot on campus. Factors such as those that fall in the lines of getting along with your roommate(s), managing time, spending time with friends,  classes, and trying to find ways to make money and so on.  That is the reason why, that if I knew what I know now about college, I think my transition from high school life to college life would have been a little easier. If I could go back in time I'd make sure that I told myself to manage my time properly, prioritize, and balance my weekly activities.Balancing weekly activities especially, because my first semester of college was stressful for me because I didn?t have that outlet of fun I needed. I studied so much that I didn?t make sure I had any fun, so therefore I always felt overwhelmed.",

My advice to myself would be to get a college education.  I have done well for myself in the workforce, working my way up into a management position.  I always look back and think that I could have achieved my successes much quicker if I had my degree.  Returning to school now so many times during a course I think how valuable the information I am learning now would have been if I had it while working up in my jobs.  Not only is the information I obtain valuable in my career but I see so much valuable information that can be applied to daily life.

When picking out a college visit them to figure out which environment feels the best for you.  If you feel comfortable there it will turn out to be the right decision.  It helped me to sit down and make a pros and cons list after I visited each college.  Another aspect to consider is the academic path.  Don't choose a college because your friends are going their if it doesn't even have your major.  Also, choose the college that offers other activities that will make you happy such as sports or organizations.  THe most important aspect to consider when choosing a college, pick the one that will make you the happiest because that is what will make your experience the best."

In my field of study, my professors work hard on retrieving grants and funding to help out with lab materials as well as the many internships that are available each year for students. I have gotten a sense of belonging as well as success from attending this school. The friendships that I have made will last a lifetime and I am truely grateful for that as well. It has truely been a valuable experience for me because I have been given so many opportunities to travel and see Medical Universities as well as highly ranked Graduate Schools.

Allen University does have some professors that will put their all into your future career. I feel that not all Allen professors are always willing to help and is there to try to understand their students. I have learned that you cannot trust any and everybody. You will meet people that will try to bring you down and it will be hard to find these people. I also have learned that Allen may have hired some professors just because maybe they could not get anyone to fill the positions because I have had teachers that have not known what they were teaching.

However, Alma also had a way of trying to sweep things under the rug. Things like: students being threatened and harassed by other students, a certain frat being known for drugging girls, etc., etc. \n\nAlso if you wonder what their Covid-19 mask policy is:\nYou have to wear a mask any time you leave your dorm room. Even if you are walking alone to starbucks. If not you will get reprimanded by a staff member. "

The people you meet on campus are nice and the professors are pretty much available whenever you need them to be. There are a lot of extracurricular activities that can be done and there are always a lot of people at the activities that you will always meet people that might become your friends. "

The food is bad but walmart is not too far so if you can cook you should go buy some groceries. College is definitely what you make it."

                "Comment": "The main reason I chose to further my education at Alma College is because of the level of education each student receives. The small class sizes allow professors to connect with their students on a more personal level and to understand each student's most effective learning techniques. Every faculty member on campus is concerned about every student's future, whether they have them in class or not.  What is most evident when walking through the classrooms is how professors are not in the classrooms just to collect a paycheck, they are there after hours to make sure they are improving and challenging their students as much as they can. As I am just finishing my freshman year, I have received opportunities I am confident that I would not have received at any other college. Through the basketball program alone, I have traveled to numerous states within the United States in order to compete against the best teams in the country. As a freshman, I was given the opportunity to travel abroad for a month to London, England and Paris, France for my Spring term. I am confident recommending Alma College to any student who is passionate about athletics, art, religion, politics, or anything else imaginable. Not only does Alma College mold and prepare students for life after college, but makes the experience enjoyable too.  "

The amount of class work is on a graduate level, alongside essays, papers and/or homework. Even though it may be a small institution it still has its vast connections into the professional or higher education world; if you are in need of any assistance whether it be financially, personally (mentally and physically) or academically they are always eager to help in any way they can and that is something that most colleges or big universities do--that they actually care for the students."

It is very costly to attend and is not an easy college academically, however help is provided at every turn along the way. I love the small and intimate atmosphere and small classroom sizes. The professors take a  personal interest in each student and help in whatever way they can.  Alma provides many services to students on campus that make campus life easier. I am pleased that Alma has renovated and listens to students and parents opinions to make it be the best that it can.  "

It's a small liberal arts school and that turns a lot of people away from attending here. Even though there may be these reasons, it's by far one of the best schools I have ever been too. Yes, it may be small, or maybe not much to do off campus, but it's a place where you can connect with people at the college in a more personal level. Classes average from 20-30 people which means that professors are able to connect with their students and know you by name and are always willing to help when in need. For me, Alma College is my home away from home. "

If you wake up five minutes before your class starts, and as long as you live on campus, there shouldn't be too much of a problem for you getting to your class relatively on time.

There are people who will encourage you to try things you might not have ever thought of doing before. I love how encouraging and accepting my school's environment is towards all walks of life. "

If you don't, you'll be $10,000 in debt, homeless, and you won't know what the inside of the rec center looks like because you get winded walking up stairs. Apply for the science fiction novel scholarship. Don't be ashamed of your mistakes, growth is not a straight, paved road. Stop making excuses about going to class and keeping toxic relationships in your life, you might not know what they'll do to you, but I know you have an idea. You were right. Keep your anger, your passion, speak up even though it feels like putting a target on your back.

The transition from high school to college is exhilarating, exciting and frightening so remember to take it all in.  Let these future experiences change you and mold you into the person you want to be.  Let the bad experiences teach you, and the good experiences give you joy.  You will be faced with adversity and hardship, but you can handle it.  You have made it this far; what is going to stop you now?

It is a change in life, but it is an amazing experience to go through and there is nothing else like it. Finally, I would tell myself to get involved with different organizations through the college. There are many great organizations that I know about now that I have made so many friends through. Being involved in different organizations also helps you get involved in the community around your college, which will only make your resume look better.

I do not live with my parents any longer, but I do live with my grandparents to save on money;  I pay them rent, my own car payment, all of school and books, food, gas, clothes etc.  Financing has been a struggle because I do not ever qualify for financial aid.  Even growing up in a time of economic struggle, I have been taught that education is important and no one can take it away from you, this is where I am inspired to do well and succeed for my own benefit.  So far, paying for school has been overwhelming, but I do feel it will be worth it in the end.   My first semester was a difficult transition, but I pushed through and have done so much better for myself getting A's in all of my classes the last couple semesters.

The classes are small, so we actually get to know people in them, and we are comfortable enough with each other that we aren't afraid to ask questions and talk to each other.

In high school, I could read a chapter once and go to class and get good grades. Well, Alma was a wake up call for my first semester. Though I recieved a 3.0, I felt that I could have pushed myself harder. I said to get away from friends and family not because I don't like mine but I was too attached. When coming to school at first I got really home sick and ended up going home every weekend. So slowly moving away could help out just a bit.",

I would tell myself to be kinder to my family and be less anxious to move out on my own into the real world.   I would tell myself to pursue things that really matter to me and could make a real difference.  I would tell myself to have a little more confidence in myself and learn to be less introverted.  And I would tell myself to value my education rather than feel that it is just something that my parents and the rest of the world make me feel obligated to complete.",

College isn't all about partying and having fun, you have to actually do work to get the grades you want. This includes doing homework and or studying for hours on end. I would've also told myself that everythings going to bed okay. You, might be away from home and everything you're used to, but you'll be back to visit, you're not leaving forever.  Also, don't  get addicted to facebook or myspace or even the internet in general. It takes up a lot of you're time that you could be using to study. The first semseter I was on facebook constantly, but then  I went home(and we don't have internet) for break and slightly cured my addiction to the internet, so i'm not on as much and have more time to do other things.",

I have met so many great people and have become involved in so many different activities that it has really opened my eyes to all the opportunities available.  I would have to warn myself of not spreading myself too thin by doing too much at once.  I would remind my high school self that I have four years here and that I do not have to do everything right at once.  I would also tell myself to get started on projects early and give myself plenty of time before a test to study.  I believe that with all this advice, I would have really been able to succeed.",

Explore even the smallest of schools, and don't feel forced to stay in one place. If somewhere is not the place for you then remind yourself that there is always another. Never give up.

It is extremly difficult to learn if you are upset and the location and school you are at is what makes things easier to learn.  Find a college/university where the professors and students are all friendly.  It is difficult to make a decision but usually your gut is right.  Pick the place that you think you will be happy at.  Do not be scared to move far away it is part of the experience. Growing up and doing things on your own.

If my mind was not open to all possibilities, I probably would've missed out on the chance to attend. Also, don't limit your mind to experiences inside of your comfort zone; sometimes it's okay to be a little adventurous. The way we learn things is to venture into territory we've never explored before. We also must follow our own hearts, and not be persuaded into thinking like the crowd, if it does not apply to our heart?s wishes. While it is okay to be a little daring, doing things because of peer-pressure almost always leads into danger.",

I also looked at Alma because of the class size, you could have classes with two proffessors and nine students, now thats what I call one on one in the classroom. My advice for a potential college student is to look at the college of your choice many times, go to the campus stay the night if you can, go back to the college for a second viset. If you still like it go to another college see how that one ranks and then go back to the college of choice. Making the most of your experience is just finding the right people who what what you want then joining a group that you will be happy in and dont go home every weekend that hurts the social life.",
                "Carly ": "I would suggest when looking for a college to visit the college more than once. I visited Alma at least 3 times to really get a feel for it. I didn't want to pick a college that I could potentially not like and have to transfer...I wanted to get it right the first time. I visited one day which included a tour with a student, stayed a night, and spoke with faculty.  Sometimes you need to just go with you gut instinct even when you are not sure.  Financial aid is always an important deciding factor so make sure you find out exactly how much money you will be receiving from each college and compare the costs.  You DO NOT want to be stuck with thousands of dollars in loans (TRUST ME! haha). \nAs for making the most out of college....just be yourself, do EVERYTHING, meet everyone.  College will be what you make of it.  You will always find a group you fit in with and you will always have the things you enjoy so don't let school change you but let yourself grow through your four years.",
                "Kelly ": "When you are looking for a college you should definitely find one that feels like home.  You should probably be able to see yourself on campus taking part of the campus activities.  One of the most important aspects of college, aside from the obvious learning is networking.  You should take as many opportunities as possible.  Join a club, study abroad, hang out with different people, etc.  You never know how its going to turn out and you don't want to leave your college experience leaving more to be desired.  The more you do, the more people you meet and  these people could be on the other side of the interview table when you are applying for a job. They may know of a job opening, or even have a friend of a friend that may know of something you might be interested in.  In today's economy it is great to have as much going for you when you are entering the real world as possible and these activities you participate in, the experiences you have (either social or job related) and the people you meet can all help you when you are entering the job market.",
                "Alaina ": "I would tell parents and/or students to not be afraid to go somewhere where you wont' know anybody. The best way to get the most out of the college experience is to put yourself in a situation in which you are forced to interact with people you don't know. By stepping outside of your normal routine, you will have more opportunities to for new experiences and to meet awesome new people. Don't be afraid to try something new even if you think you won't  be good at it or hesitate to join a club because you dont know everything about it. Get out there and learn about the world around you and you'll be surprised about how much you learn about yourself in the process.",

I owe alot to my college career!\" You only have one life, don't let it get put in to the back pages of a textbook.",
                "Alissa ": "Parents: Do not pressure your student regardless of temptation.  Every parent wants their child to attend their alma mater, but it is important for each student to find that place that is going to change their life.  It is also very important for parents to find that middle ground of still caring about your kid but letting go at the same time.  Especially during the first year of college, a student needs space to find out who they are going to be.  Many students re-make themselves during college and figure out what they really want out of life; let them do that.\n\nStudents:  First, when choosing a college, find the place that is going to change your life.  Then take advantage of every opportunity you can.  Get involved in every activity that seems interesting, do all kinds of service work, and if the school allows chances to travel, do it.  College is the time to explore the world and find out what you want to do with your life.  There is no other time in life like it and there are opportunities around every corner."

The only problem I ran into is that some classes only run in spring or fall, plus one of my classes was canceled due to not enough people enrolled. It was a class that I needed for my degree, so now I'll have to take it at university for 5 times the cost. "

                "Comment": "Alpena Community College is an outstanding institution that gives students a wide range of possibilities to succeed academically and in the community. The small class sizes allow for a greater educational experience and teacher-student relationship. Also, the availability of the teachers is an enormous advantage because it allows for the student to obtain a greater educational experience. I believe that this is a great school with a lot of opportunities. For example, we have a vast array of extracurricular activities and clubs to get involved with. Our clubs range from academic based to hobby based. I love the ability to be able to be involved in an honor society and also be able to be involved in a group that is made around a hobby. For instance, we have a video game club and a language society club. There is a large diversity of interests at our school and I love that we can join groups that play toward our interests. So, in my opinion, Alpena Community College is a great school that takes into account every student's academic interests. "

I spent five years after graduating high school of being in and out of community college and I finally decided on a future for myself. But along the way, never did I ever actually finish my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts, or anything for that matter! Now I'm five years behind for starting my life and feel like I havn't accomplished anything. I would definitely jump out of that time machine and kick myself in the butt!",
                "Kelcey ": "You should focused on the quality of the education you are receiving rather than the \"college experience\". While partying may be fun while it lasts, it won't make a bit of difference in you job prospects and if you're partying instead of studying it could actually decreased them. Whatever school you go to make sure it has a good program for what you're pursuing. While prestige is important, you don't have to spend $50,000 a year just for a degree. We all know that  a degree in buttsniffing from Harvard is more respected than graduating Summa Cum Laude from almost any other university but you have to ask yourself \"is it worth it?\". Consider going to a community college. No one will have concerns over you spending a year or two at a community college in the long run (despite what some people say) as they'll be looking at where you get your Bachelors as a Bachelors cancels out your associates degree.  Lastly, if you need help, don't be afraid to ask for some. There are plenty of services a colleges to get  you through whatever problem you may have."

It can be hard for these individuals to attend school events if they feel uncomfortable being around people they don\\'t necessarily know. Regarding academics, it is obviously made a priority for majority of the professors. They are usually easy to reach and are willing to meet and discuss grades or current questions you have regarding classes.  "

The class size is important because it determines how much time you will receive with your professor and having less people means a lot more time. Also, all the teachers have different teaching styles which gives you a sense of many different ways you learn. Having the many different areas to sit down and finish school work is important, your education is the most important thing and you should use all the resources you can to be as successful as you want to be.

However, the sciences are a main focus at the school and the other programs seem to fall off the wayside. All of the professors are very nice and approachable, but it seems as though the courses that are in the sciences, such as nursing and occupational therapy, are the ones that have the most dedicated and challenging professors. The campus itself is beautiful and the sense of community is strong. The food is pretty good for college food, and the resources for the students are also good. There are many things in the surrounding area, but there are also many activities and clubs for students to get involved in. The Office of Student Activities always has something fun going on and sports are always an option too. The athletics are not the greatest at Alvernia, but they are growing in popularity and competitiveness each year. I have heard that the coaching staff on some of the teams are not great, but that the student-athletes themselves are dedicated. Overall, Alvernia University has many options for students to succeed in college and in their lives in general. The school is very science-based, so those programs are amazing. Everything else, as far as majors go, are options but are not as strong as they might be somewhere else."

I have grown to really appreciate and love our school. The professors are amazing and always available to help, which is different from most schools because with larger schools most professors don't even know half of the students and making appointments is a nightmare. At Alvernia, the professors encourage you to visit their offices anytime and are more than happy to help you with anything, not only their classes. There are a lot of opportunities though out our school, not only academically. When it comes to the social life as well, I haven't met anyone who I haven't liked so far. It is a very friendly environment, and everyone there is mainly focused on their studies."

The first bit of advice I would give myself would be to get more involved in school. I would tell myself to join all of the clubs I wanted to join, pick up a new hobby. I would have told myself to stop being in my little shell and make those connections with people. This would have made making new friends much easier in college. It would also have made getting involved much easier. Knowing I had social anxiety, I would tell my senior self to get help for that and make myself a new person, to reinvent myself. I also would have told myself to take better care of myself because trying to juggle school, work and trying to get in shape is a challenge. I also wish I could tell my past self to start saving more money. I never believed the stereotype of a broke college student until now. I would tell myself to change for the better.",

My goal in life is to be a pediatric nurse practictioner because of what happened to my little sister. I would have told myself this was not going to be easy road, and that this program was going to drain me completely. But would have reminded myself of the reasoning behind my dream and all that necessary hard work.  Fianlly, I would have explained to myself the relevancy of community service. At my school, community serivce hours are required for graduation. I thought this was rediculous when I first apllied to go to Alvernia.

Not only is it an entirely new environment concerning your social life, but it is also a different academic environment. You have to work much harder than you would have ever imagined in school because quite frankly it isn't easy. You can't procrastinate and wait until the last minute to do everything because trust me, it will show in your grades. And even though professors don't give homework that has to be handed in every day, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't study every day- because the studying IS your homework and that is what will you get you the grades that you are used to seeing.

I would also warn myself about the reading that must be done.  The amount of time that is needed to study to be fully prepared for exams, quizzes, and other assignments is astronomical compared to the time needed in high school.  So, I'd end the conversation with a smile, handshake, and say, \"you better refine those study habits, or you'll be in trouble.\"",

I'd also advise myself to pick a major with credits that are easily transferrable to other colleges as not to risk having to wasting my Pell grant. In fact, I would add, I need to choose my major wisely because Pell will only cover for 12 semesters.. I would have also told myself to get treated for ADD so that I'd focus better in college. Lastly, I'd advise myself to get help learning how to write papers to avoid flunking certain classes that involve lots of writing.",

You don't know what jobs will be like in 4-6 years so pick what you love, not what will make you loads and loads of money. Life is about living your dream, loving your job, and being happy. I would then talk to myself about the stress. Syllabus week might turn you away, but just think about it this way you have WEEKS to accomplish all of those things, and you will accomplish all of those things. College can be stressful, but you just have to think that when you are done with school you will be out in the real world with real responsibilities. Just enjoy the school setting, enjoy meeting new people, try new things, because once you are in the real world there is no going back.

Being in high school, it is best to keep up your GPA and to make sure that you get the most out of it. With having the help and support of your friends and family will also help with making the right choice for the college you have chosen. For me being in college at a older age, it seems to be best to make the most of what you have to live for to get the best job that will last for a long time.

My dreams have been with me all of my life and they should not be thrown away because of one person. I will never give up on myself, but when times get hard, I know I have to stay strong.

My world, kindergarten through senior year, was two buildings separated by a parking lot; a high school with only three hallways; and I loved it. I never thought much about college or finding a job; I was perfectly happy in my bubble. Then near the end of my junior year, it popped! I was suddenly faced with ACT scores, college and scholarship applications, financial aid, and everyone asking me where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do with my life. I was so overwhelmed that I pushed everything aside and decided not to worry about it, which unfortunately, came with many consequences. I always tell myself, that if I could go back, I would give myself the help that I never had. I would have joined more clubs, made more connections, gotten scholarships, and graduated with the best, and everyone would be so proud.

Both of my parents were raced in Mexico, they did not have the opportunity to experience the life that they have provided my siblings and me with.  As I looked for advice from my family they gave me the best knowledge that they could without knowing exactly what to expect. If I could go back in time with this knowledge and experienced I would make sure that college was worthwhile. It was a wonderful experience but there are several things that I would do differently. First I would pay close attention to the people I surrounded myself with. It is very important to be around positive and ambitious people so that you can excel. I would also take more advantage of school activities by becoming more proficient in scheduling time for schoolwork and extracurricular activities. I would mostly take advantage of studying abroad because it would have broadened my understanding and viewpoints of different cultures and their perspectives. Overall being active within the school is very important because it would help in finding ambitious people that could result in life long friendship, knowledge and memories.",

Throughout my high school career, I was always under the impression that the teachers were preparing us for college life. My freshman year in college, I found this to be false. The teachers did do as much as they could but I realized that it was actually up to the students to make sure they were prepared. This includes getting good grades, getting involved in activities, and setting up good study processes. These aspects carry over to college life and make it easier to transition more quickly if students already have things planned out. I know the rest of my college career will be easier to transition to since I now have an idea of what it is like, but I do wish I would have worked harder in high school to better prepare myself with or without the help of others.",

You kinda let yourself go by 30lbs. It's not too great. Most importantly, get better grades. I know it sucks, but just do it. If you don't listen to anyone else, listen to yourself...

In doing so i ended up wasting the first year of high school failing every class but P.E  During second year I tryed buckling down  staying focused and getting  my grades up. \n    Grades were not great but  I did pass every class. Since I did'nt pass the previous year I wanted to change schools I was to ashamed  to stay in the same school.  Thank GOD the new school  I was attending  happen to be a alternative school .  By taking extra online classes and summer school, I was able to play catch up enabling me to graduate on time .

I would advise myself to save more money for school. I would also advise myself to seek a consular about opportunities for financial aid.

I would remind myself that high school is not the end, it is more like a beginning because college is where you really start to grow and develop into the human being you will be for the rest of your life.

I wasted my first year of college on a major I knew I didn't like just because I felt pressured to begin college with a major. I chose Elementary Education because it was a job I knew that I thought I'd be able to handle. Within the first semester I could tell this wasn't what I wanted to do with my life. I sat down one day during my freshman year of college and started researching various medical field jobs. I stumbled across Occupational Therapy (which I had never heard of before) and knew it was something I was extremely interested in. Now I have a major that I love. I would highly recommend searching for jobs yourself; because school doesn't introduce you to many jobs out there, and that job that you never heard of might end up being a career you love. Don't settle for a career just because it was mentioned on career day in high school.",

Even now that I am about to be a parent it has become hard to balance the cost of school and baby needs. Most of all I\u2019d really be telling myself in high school to apply. I\u2019d say even if the scholarship was too hard or too simple make time to fill it out because it will help in the future. Addition to applying for scholarships my senior year I\u2019d as well truly focus on my major and what I would like to achieve later in life.

The 1st skill I received from college is critically thinking.  This skill is priceless to me because it gives me a dynamic path of thought to answer and make decisions based on various types of questions or situations.  Arithmetic reasoning is the 2nd skill that college has given me and with this capability I am able to experience and/or perceive a natural phenomena and than model that circumstance by using mathematics and conceptual knowledge to answer questions and pioneer new ideas.  The final gift that college has awarded me with is a dynamic, clear, and efficient way of communication.  This invaluable ability gives me a means to express my ideas and systems of ideas to others so that those thoughts are comprehensible and require the least amount of time I need to convey my thoughts to people.  No matter how I attain a drive or joy, it will come from one of these abilities that college gave to me.",

Through discussions and campus events I have been exposed to the knowledge of injustices in the world and organizations trying to make the world a better place.

One would be to experience more class types in high school, because it helps to have a clear understanding about what path you want to go down.  After coming into college as a business major, I quickly realized that was not the path I was destined to go, and could have easily found out by taking a business class in school.  I would also tell myself that people you meet in orientation will not be the same people you see come winter break.  College changes people, some for the good, and some for the bad.  It's important that you recognize who will be there for you come graduation and after and who you will quickly grow to annoy you.  Being in college is a great experience that requires work, discipline, time management, and a knack for taking chances and experiencing all that it offers.

Starting over and going back to school as an adult can be done but life would have been a whole lot easier had you finished your schooling when you young.  If you are ever unsure about classes or school speak to an advisor or someone that will encourage you.  You need a strong support system and positive encouragement.  Whatever you do Do not  drop out and give up.",
                "Amanda ": "If I knew that having a degree would have helped me get futher in my career and my life I would have never waited to go.  I have worked dead end jobs for the last 12 years. Until recently I thought that I would never have a job that I could and would love to do. Not only does having a degree help with finding a career it helps complete a person. I feel that the knowledge you get in school is not only for your career or job, but it completes another chapter of a person. School does not make into a person that you could or should be, but it helps you become the person that you want to be. If I could go back and talk to my high school self I think I wold tell her that school will complete the person she wants to become.",

The first is I would have told myself to apply for more scholarships because there is so many available to high school students, therefore I would not have to work so much while still attending college full time. I would have also told myself to work hard and not to procrastinate even if it was my senior year! To remember at least fifty percent of what I have learned in high school to help me transition into college. Opposed to just memorizing the information for a test, and forgetting it the next day. By studying a few days before a test and not procrastinating this way I could carry my knowledge from high school into college and eventually to my workplace.",
                "Jennifer ": "I would tell my high school self to not wait to finish my education. I would also encourage myself to participate in more extracurricular clubs and activities as well as begin looking for scholarshjips and things during high school.  It also would have probably been better for me to not attend a vocational school during high school and focused on taking more college prep courses.  I would tell myself to go for my goals and don't settle due to not having the financial support of one of  her parents.",
                "Jessica ": "When considering a college it is imperative to examine the quality of education, availability of intended major, enthusiasm of professors, available resources, and the amount of possible financial aid. Quality of education, although hard to determine from a few pamphlets and an overnight visit, can be shown through the success rate of alumni in the workforce, the opinions of students attending, and in some cases classroom sizes. If the student is looking for lecture-style classrooms, then he or she should look for schools in which many of the classrooms are structured in that way so as to get the most out of the classroom experience. Similarly, if hoping for one-on-one, approachable professors, then the student may want to examine smaller schools. The quality of education also depends on the program the school has for the student's intended major. This program should be strengthened by internship opportunities and variety in curriculum.  College is designed to open the eyes of students to new opportunities, so research the interaction between the institution and community. Finally, make sure that the college is affordable and that financial aid will help with any remaining costs. Happy college hunting!",

                "Bethany ": "I would tell myself that I don't need to go to school to be a teacher like my mother wants, that I should just persue the Electronics Engineering Degree that I want.  I would tell myself that I need to keep working hard and studying hard, but most importantly, to persue the degree that I know is right for me, and to keep the 3.7 GPA.  About the problems that my mother would cause when I decided to change my major and how she then decided to claim me on her taxes so that I couldn't use my own tax information to apply for loans.  And that I would have to wait to go back to school until she could no longer do this.  I would stand up to my mother, who knows, if I had, I would probably already have my Electronics Engineering Degree.  I just want to work hard, earn my degree, and find a good, stable job.  I would stress working hard and keeping my GPA up.",
                "Lyudmila ": "I came to this country from Ukraine 9 years ago.  i wonted to go back to the level I was in my country: nurse-midwife.  It took time to learn english at first and then start from the beginning.  I studied so hard because it was my second language and many words were new to me. I became a RN and started to work in the Labor and Delivery unit.  So that was a little bit  closer to my dream.  to become a midwife in USA i had to accomplish BSN first.  Now, I am almost finished my BSN and looking into applying for graduate school at University of PENN.  This is a great school, but also very expansive.  It would not discourage me, i will continue to proceed with my dreams and do what i need to.  So, on that note, my advice to all, do your school when you can, do not let anything to hold you back.  It is easier to do it when you are single and can concentrate on your school only.  Otherwise, it can take a looooong time.  Thank you all.  Good luck.",

Everybody here is not only working towards their own goals, but helping other people achieve theirs too.",

The professors are excellent in getting everybody involved and making sure everybody understands the material.  The professors thuroughly enjoy teaching and it is shown in the classroom.  The classes are never over 40 students which makes it easy to be known by the professor.",

The classes are small enough that you get that one on one time with the professor and it gives you the opportunity to get to know them as well as them get to know you! Everyone looks out for eachother and thats what I love most about Alvernia University. I couldn't have chosen a better college.",
                "Rebecca": "The best thing about my school, Alvernia University, is everything. It is impossible to say one thing that this school does best. I love the fact that if I ever need help, there is always a staff group aviable for help. This school sets us up for success, not to take our money and watch us fail. They want the best for us and I am willing to do my best to spread how amazing of a school this is. I was given an equal oppurtinity to succeed and to get to where I want to be in life.",

The campus is very nice and offers many ammenties like exercise classes and a commuter lounge for their older population.",

The college treats you like an individual, not just like another person attending. The class sizes range from 10-25 people per class, so you get to know your classmates and instructors (which is what we call our professors). There aren't any lecture halls, so you get one-on-one communication with your instructor. As far as working on campus, they make sure you still have plenty of time to get your schoolwork done while still making money. Alverno  is one of the best schools I have looked into, and I do not regret one bit coming here. It really feels like a home away from home."

The class setting is nice and small, it's way better than those everyday lecture halls that they have at larger colleges. Overall Alverno is pretty great."

They also make sure you know that being a woman is something to be proud of, and it doesn't and should not limit you whatsoever. I recommend it to those who may even be a little intimidated by college, and afraid of getting help, because you always will have a helping hand. Alverno College has turned me into the strong, motivated, and hard working woman I am today, and I still have plenty of time to continue the growth."

For example, because I took and did well in calculus already I was able to get credit for both College Algebra and Trigonometry.   The professors are always willing to meet out of class.  I have some physical disabilities and the school was very willing to work with me to set up a plan to help me out including extra time to complete assessments if need be and extra time to complete assignments if I need it.  My only complaint would be food.   I can't eat gluten and that limits my options a bit so I end up eating a lot of salads.  The other students and the professors are really supportive and genuinely want everyone to succeed.  I absolutely recommend Alverno!"

Likewise, there are tons of networking opportunities and you can tell everyone, including the staff, want to see you succeed as not only a student, but as an individual especially after graduation."

By following one's own dreams, regardless of what others want for you, you will ultimately be more happy with yourself and in the future, doing what brings you the utmost happiness and joy out of life! Secondly, not being afraid to ask for help is important as it unveils your longing to learn more that what you already do, and in doing so, you will find assurance and become more confident in yourself along the college journey. Lastly, making friends and becoming part of a social group, whether it be just with one or two friends makes you feel more connected to college, especially if they are studying the same things you are.

So one thing that I would definitely go back and tell my high school senior self, is to start looking into colleges and possible majors sooner than later, and apply on time to attend the fall semester. I would also say that even if you don\u2019t decide a major right away, it\u2019s okay to start college with an undecided major, because the first semester\u2019s schedule will be mostly made up of general education courses that are required for everyone anyway.

When it comes to school there is no such thing as a stupid question, because there is a 99% chance that someone else is wondering the same thing. I would tell myself to be confident in my work when I know I've done well and to set my pride aside and admit when I haven't done so well. College is no joke, it takes hard work and patience, and I'm not always going to be able to figure it out on my own, and it's okay to ask for help.

I would start out with telling myself not to worry about high school and start looking for scholarships because college is expensive and time consuming. I would reassure myself that I can accomplish my dreams. I would also tell myself to stay focused and ignore the bullies that enter your path. I would also inform my self about Alverno and how it is the perfect school for me. It is not big and it is a focused school. I would give myself a hug and tell myself to stay positive. Without positivity everything will feel bad and not enjoyable. My final thoughts to myself would be that you are born to be a teacher and staying organize, positive, and calm will always keep your mind at ease. Don't sweat the small stuff, and continue on your pathway to success. You can do this, and everything will work out as long as you are patient and greatful for the opportunities you are given. Good Luck!",
                "Cory": "If I could talk to myself as a high school senior I would tell myself not to take any experience for granted. The social life and experiences of college are just as important as the academics. As you start to inevitably drift away from your high school friends, you\u2019ll form new life-long friendships with your college friends. Even if you\u2019re tired and don\u2019t feel like it, go to the party or go out. Going out and meeting people helps with the transition because at one point everyone was going through the exact same things as you and you can bond over it. Think of all the experiences and people you\u2019re missing out on because you\u2019d rather sleep! College only lasts for four years and you have the rest of your life to nap or watch Netflix. Also, take any and all opportunities to travel because you\u2019ll never get the opportunity again to travel to another country for so cheap. Even if you think you can\u2019t afford it, make it happen by applying for more scholarships, having a bake sale, or getting a loan. Live fully the four years you\u2019re in college!",

The summer between my High School graduation and my Freshman year I was full of anxiety that I wouldn't fit in, that I wasn't prepared, that I wouldn't be good enough. When I got to Alverno however I quickly found out that it's a place that's really easy to fit into. People are friendly, helpful and understanding and the work load while heavy and challenging was also doable. Professors were helpful and ready to explain subjects in more detail if you didn't understand them. All in all the transition into Alverno was easier and actually a lot more fun than I expected. All the worrying I did wasn't worth it and if I could go back I would tell myself just not to worry and to enjoy what little time as a child I had left.",

To save myself the stress I have had as a freshman and sophomore college studnet if I could go back in time and advice myself as a senior in high school my top advice would be to do a better job in finding college funding.",
                "Michelle": "Michelle I know that your teachers, parents, and highschool advisors are pressuring you to  attend college immediately after you graduate highschool, because they say if you don't you'll never go back to school.  But I urge you to not listen to them!  You must take your time, and go when you are in a mentally, and financially healthy place.  Equally important Michelle, do not let a jobs income influence your choice of major.  It's important that you follow your heart and personal interests and desires, because only they will fuel your drive to complete college and excell in your classes.  Last but not least Michelle, I know your social anxiety gets in the way of your ability to meet knew people, but you must not fear living in the college dorms.  In fact I strongly reccomend that you live in a college dorm for one year, because it will help college become a home for you, which is a good thing trust me! The dorms will help you to make new friends and living on campus will keep you focused by providing a quiet study enviroment and friends you can relate to.  Good Luck!  I love you!",
                "cynthia": "If I could go back to speak to myself with the knowledge I have now it would be a short conversation. I would start with saying college is all about you. Every decision you make from this point on will determine the success you have in college. It's important for you to start mapping out your long term goals now, if they change along the way its ok. Continue to know that your family loves and support you with everything you do\u2019 even if it doesn't always seem that way. On your journey to a higher education you will face many challenges, but there is nothing you can\u2019t get through. Keep confidence in yourself and wake up every day knowing you have a purpose in this life.",

I would still commute the two hours everyday to my university, I would still work full time, and I would still work just as hard as I did. Who I was my first year of college made me who I am today. I now have my first year of college paid off and I am now living less than one block away from my school with enough scholarships to where I can pay off my second year of college.",

Also, escaping my shell and making friends that I consider family.  Throughout my high school years I had struggled academically and never would have thought about going to college because I considered myself \"not smart enough.\" Walking through Alverno's doors, I had a feeling that I was meant to go to this school, every faculty at Alverno was and still is supportive and helpful. Alverno has a variety of resources and opportunities to become successful. With the small classes, I get more one on one interaction with my classmates and professors which is better for me to learn whether than being known as a number and not knowing my classmates. Alverno is very valuable to attend because they don\u2019t use letter grades to grade you, they have successful or unsuccessful. Also, every assignment you do whether it is homework, assessments, or quizzes the professors gives you feedback on areas you did well on and what you need to improve.",

This college was valuable for me to attend because it reminded me so much of myself, private, woman, determined. I have never had such great teachers in my life, most whom I feel actually care about me. I feel empowered, and have gained so much confidence from this school that was long missing.",

I have made friends that will last for life and I have gained more knowledge in my major, psychology. Attending college helped me to build some character and to become more independent. I have learned how to take care of myself and become more responisble. I have learned how to figure things out on my own and I have had fun with all of the challenges college presents. College has been a great experience and I hope to eventually receive my Masters in psychology.",

I see myself going far in life, and expecting more out of myself.  I have a 1 year old daughter who I would love to tell me one day that she is proud of my accomplishments. It has been valued to attend because I believe without a college education life would be so hard, but when one does have an education and a college degree life is so easy. A teacher once told me work now play later, and the fact that I am working now on my degree assures me that at the end I will be happy and able to live life to the fullest.",

Alverno has small class sizes, but most importantly the instructors care. Because of that, I was able to become the successful student I am today. I understand the material, and I can show that I know it without simply regurgitating what my instructor said; I have learned the importance of communication, community involvement, and knowledge itself. Alverno has made me want to continue my education by pursuing a master?s degree, or some other form of academic accomplishment. Alverno has helped me find who I am, and has helped me become a successful and powerful woman.",

I found out about the student ministries before I decided to go to Wallace State, and they were so helpful, and they really sounded like they wanted to be my friend and wanted me to come to Wallace.  I also came for a volleyball scholarship.  My volleyball team has taught me a lot about character, and I have learned a lot about myself as well.  Wallace has allowed me to grow and learn is a safe and free environment.  I do not feel threatened or judged at Wallace.  I have been able to discuss real life questions and serious discussions during class with other students and professors.  I do not wish to leave Wallace State, but it has prepared me to move on, and now I'm ready to further my education at a four year university.",
                "Ann ": "Alverno College bases its curriculum on eight abilities that students develop and refine throughout their education. Abilities used to shape women at the school are: communication, analysis, problem solving, valuing in decision making, social interaction, global perspective, effective citizenship, and aesthetic engagement.  Expansion of these eight abilities have enabled me to competently transition to the professional world as a registered nurse and present myself as a polished graduate of the Alverno College system. My current graduate work at Loyola University in Chicago in the Family Nurse Practitioner and Emergency Nurse Practitioner Program and my immediate hire at Children's Hospital of Wisoconsin as a Registered Nurse upon program completion  are only two examples of success I attribute to the ability based curriculum at Alverno.  I look forward to continually evolving the quality of these personal abilities through out my life and discover my potential in each field.",

I would also try to look for more scholarships in differnt places. Many of us don't think about college a lot because we don't know what it is like, but because I have been in college for two years, I have learned how hard it is for me as a college student to find the money to pay for tuition and books. There are many things I would say, but the most important is to apply for financial aid early because that would give you a better chance of getting more money for college. Also to look for outside scholarships, and look for loans with low interest rates. I think that people should always look foward to attending college because that is essential and there are oportunities available for all. The only thing you would need to do is to look for help, and don'tbe afraid of what can happen. Just go for it and succeed.",

There is no more time for slacking off or trying to get away with things because it simply does not work any more.  Hard work and determinatin are the keyes to success which became apparent to me when I entered college.",
                "Calpurnia ": "I am a nursing major, before I came to Alverno I was at a state university. What Alverno has that a state university does not have, is team work. Alverno strongly emphasizes team work. Team work is important to me because in the health care setting you would not be able to function without team work. A hospital would not be able to run without team work. I value my experience here because it taught me how to efficiently work in a team and be a team player.",

I also would have advised myself to have taken more classes that could have helped me more with the major I am pursuing. I would have taken classes that rewarded you college credits, so I wouldn?t have to spend thousands of dollars in college.  I also would have practiced how to manage my time with school, fun, and work. College is not fun and games, it?s an education you shouldn't play with and take very seriously. Fun comes once you have graduated with your degree and education. Some more advise I would have given myself is, I learn that in college there is a lot of reading and writing so I also would have told myself to write more and get that extra help when I was lost or confused. As a senior I would have advised myself to take my time and proof read all my work and showed all my teachers my true potential. Also in high school I should have enrolled in different programs to practice my networking and applied for more scholarships and grants.",

If I do not know how to look for scholarships, I would tell myself to ask my counselor for help. Also, I can go online and look for scholarhips. The reason why I am giving myself this advice is because college is expensive and tuition is increasing as time goes by.  By applying for scholarships, you will at least get some money to help with tuition, books, and other necessities for college.",

If you do not succeed in high school you may not get into a good college. If you do not go to college you may end up working a dead end job the rest of your life. I would tell myself to buckle down and study hard.",

Since I have to pay for my own education, I spent a lot of my senior year worrying about how much debt I'd be in.  Instead of finding a counselor or teacher to help me fill out a FAFSA, I decided to stay out of college for a year and work to save up money.  If I could, I would shake some sense into myself for thinking that I wouldn't be able to afford going to a private college!  There are so many scholarships, aid and grants available that most students, like me, don't take advantage of.  Had I applied to more scholarships when I had all of that time as a senior, I would probably be going to college for free right now.  For now though, I have to work to pay for school until I graduate...or get a scholarship!",

When I was a college senior, my mother was using heroin, I didn't know my father, my grandmother just had passed from breast cancer, and I was living in my own apartment.  It took me until I was 22 until I got my life together enough to get enrolled in college, I still don't know my father and I don't really speak to my mother because she sold the laptop I recieved from my aunt for college.

I need to become more responsible and see the consequences my actions have in the future. I would tell me that I can make a difference if I just concentrate more. I would tell myself this in high school because I lost focus of what was important. I now attend a good college and I have the opportunity to reach my goals in life. My goal in life is to be Pediatrician, I am majoring in chemistry and nursing.  I am prepared to face on the challenges I have ahead of me.

It will especially make my parents proud because they all want me and my siblings to all go to college and further our education.  In addition, going to college makes you more independent, and feel more of like an adult. If I didn't go to college, I would be missing out on a lot of things that could change and help me in life.",

I would have never had my first daughter who now has a daughter of her own. That mistake may have been purposely.  Sure it ruined my social life but the greatest thing of being human is the power of creation. Wheather it be  life or work. So no. I don't wish to go back and fix my wrongs. I have to live with them like it or not. Ask a child the same question and you get so much insight and wisdom.  So if it were my choice. I'd reteach myself.

The student-professor relationships blossom, every professor is willing to go above and beyond to see each student excel and to also challenge the students. It is will great pride to say I started at ACC, they work very well with promoting dual credit to the local high school students and making their first college years the best.\u200b"

                "Juan": "Juan, when you transition over to your first year in college make sure that you study hard. I suggest and I really hope you do leave behind all the habits of studying loosely or not studying at all because, if you do not study, then college is going to be really hard. I would also suggest that you make some friends. I you manage to make friends then classes will not be so hard or maybe even seem boring for not interacting with others.",
                "Sharon ": "If I had known what I know now when I had graduated college I would have made different decisions.  First when I applied for college I felt very over whelmed.   I did not do all that I should have during high school like take higher educated classes to prepare myself for college.  I would have studied more and taken more time to learn more what college has to offer.  Knowing that I wanted to go to college I should have not done a co-op class just so I can leave school early.  I would have taken more prep classes to be ready to handle the college classes and test.   Education is so important today in the work world.  Most jobs require that you have at least a 4 yr degree.  That is why I am returning to the class room to do what I should have done before having a full time job that I have capped out at due the lack of higher education.",
                "Scotte ": "Life as it is now is oversimplified to a fault. Relish it, embrace it, experience it.  Do things you'll regret, make memories, waste nothing.  Listen to all of the tiresome cliches and try to hear the resonance of truth in them --  life is what you make of it, waste not want not, home is where the heart is. Err, scratch that last one. Anyhow, never fail to take risks or pass opportunities with potential. As dull as it may sound now, give back to your community, others, loved ones -- you'll come to appreciate the serene  feeling gained through the joy and respect of fellow humans (plus it looks good for colleges!) Basically, just don't ever miss a beat -- be you, no more, no less, and take nothing for granted.",
                "Susan ": "My advice to the younger, skinnier me would be to take some dual credit classes while in high school (articulated classes).  It would have saved me a lot of time and money! I pay for college out of my own pocket, so two things I give up constantly are my time and hard earned cash; Two things that were plentiful but under appreciated in my blossoming years. I worked during high school but all I did with the money was buy Abercrombie clothing and other non-necessities (bedazzled hair clips, Dr. Marten boots, Coach purses, coconut scented hair towels??!, etc).  If I would've just saved at least $50 per paycheck, I would be sitting prettier and a bit more educated than I am now. Ah, to be young and naive....and now? Older and regretful.",
                "La ": "I would tell my high school self that just because you are making A's now dig deeper. College is a whole different world but it is a great experience and you should cherish it.",
                "Sheri ": "The discussion I would have with myself if I could go all the way back to 1985 is to not wait this long to go to college.  Go right out of high school, it is important because study habits are fresh, responsibilities are fewer and stress level is lower.  A career is important in this day and time  while having an income that can support a family.  Also, going to college right out of high school is a great start to being on your own and learning responsibility.    I would warn myself to study hard and to not put off assignments because it catches up with you and makes everything alot harder.  Hold your head up high, have confidence and believe in yourself and follow your dreams!   It's worth every second, sweat and tear...\n\nSheri Low",
                "Jewel ": "I would convince myself and my parents to \"go away\" to college. I had a really good job when I graduated and focused more on work then school.  I would tell myself that the four(ish) years you are in college will be the easiest time for you to focus on college, and your future.  It is hard to get those years back and it gets harder to be able to keep that focus on school. I would force myself to see that it I am smarter then I think I am, and that I am capable of becoming anything I want to be, even if I am not sure what that is yet. I would also suggest saving money for when I go to a university, to avoid being in debt when I graduate with my degree.",
                "Shonda ": "If I could go back in time, I would explain about all of the available scholarships and financial aid available for college.  I would explain the reasons for going to college and how it will benefit me.  The many reasons for going to college would be an education is important to obtain  a good career in a field you will enjoy.",

It's not because the college was a Harvard level of prestige, which wasn't a bad thing in fact, the reason I choice it was because of the reason above. Amarillo isn't the biggest town, but it's way bigger than Pampa, where I'm from, and Amarillo was the perfect size for me to adjust to what city life would somewhat be like, and that's not to say Amarillo is a bad college, or even a mediocre one. I'd say it's a great college in fact, every professor I've had have been honestly helpful and with good intentions. Amarillo College was the perfect upgrade from the prison that was High School."

The caveat to this institution is the life outside of classes as most students are apathetic of their studies. Furthermore; there are a lot of student activities, but little who partake in them.  Despite this however, most students succeed here and find ways to get involved. Overall, Amarillo College provides the students with many opportunities in getting their students into a career or 4 year university. It is an excellent pathway to accomplishing your academic goals."

I'd also tell myself to study and do my homework. Teachers always say we're getting you ready for college, but in reality they aren't. They just tell you to do your homework, they don't encourage doing it. They don't teach you study techniques, or even explain how hard college can be.  The last thing I'd tell myself is to start saving money for school. Saving money for college is very important, and if you start early you are able to buy everything you need to be ready to start school.  You might get scholarships, but those go to the school.

Grades are not given, but they are actually earned.

If the assignment is not complete the zero what you recieve.

It combines the support and resources required for successful student learning with the convenience of having a flexible schedule, as well as doing your work from the comforts of your own home. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and always available to their students. From the financial advisors to the instructors, they are at the top of their game. The campus is beautiful, and its cafe is divine! My only criticism would be that they don't seem to offer a lot of financial help aside from helping students with their FASFA application.\n"

What caught my attention about American Institute is that the medical assisting program can be completed in as little as 12 months which is awesome. I can enter the medical field fast and not have to wait years. Also, it a great entry level for students who later want to pursue nursing. So far, I really like the professors and the environment of the school. "

Before you head off to college though, there are some things you should know.  \nFirst and foremost, you are oh so very smart.  Don't believe what your high school's atmosphere has taught you for so very long.  You can do this, and you will see when you get into college just how very smart you are.  You're going to work very hard and get good grades and succeed the best you can.  And you will love school.\nThat's another thing.  You need to love to learn.  College is different from high school, you will have opportunities you didn't have before.  Don't leave your passion behind, take it to college with you.  And be prepared to learn outside the classroom as well.  You are about to enter a culture entirely new to you.  Listen to the people around you share their stories, and let them help you grow as a person in understanding and compassion.\nWell, that's it!  Good luck!\nAll the best,\nAbi",

Tour them, if necessary, and research. Continue to gradually narrow that list down as the days go by. After all that, oh ever so fun, college application process, sit back and find out logistics about each prospective school. Base your opinions off research and personal visits. Maybe the large state school is just too daunting, maybe the quaint, compact setting tucked into a city is just right. Knowing what I know now, I would have told my high school senior alias to not even bother looking at larger state schools, because they aren't as generous with scholarship and loan packages, and are far too expansive. Massive schools like that are basically their own world, an easy one to get lost in. Smaller, private schools are much more forgiving in the financial aid process and are certainly a whole lot easier to navigate!",

If you want a fun senior year to remember, embrace the application process, drop any negativity, and just be happy.  I know if I were given the chance to avoid or even redo a few moments, I would avoid come relationships and create others immediately.  I also wouldn't be so worried about picking out the right college.  It just hits you.  I thought I would never go to AIC but once i visited it I fell in love.

Now I'm trying to scrounge around for money to go to the college I want to attend due to MY lack of care towards academics and what I was to do for college.   I thought I could skim by through everything in life and come out unscathed.  I guess this results from being too much of a momma's boy.

I was wrong when every four year college I applied to sent me a letter stating I was not accepted. It is important for any student attending high school to make school there number one priority but also focus on extra curricular activites that make them happy, being well-rounded is very important when applying to colleges.

Despite the problems that I go through I need to know that I could be whatever I want to be depending on my college major even if someone thinks its a farfetched goal or job in the near future.  If I believe in myself and put my mind to it, I could get far no matter if their is obstacles in my way that are big or small. I would also tell myself that in college there is always going to be an obstacle or a curve ball that come at me, I just have to know how to get passed it with whatever technique it maybe.

There have been a few occasions where I have felt like giving up college. However, I realize that college is the best long term option. Developing a passion and being committed to what I am learning are essential aspects in obtaining my degree. \nFinally, I have learned to be more punctual. Over the course of my life, I have possessed a habit of being late for important events. However, college has helped neutralize this and turn me into a more dependable person. Being punctual is an essential aspect of being successful in the workforce. I believe that college has been exactly what I have needed to discard myself of my imperfect habits.",

Not to say that college isn\u2019t hard work, because it is; but the satisfaction you receive after getting a good grade on a test or getting high marks during the semester are worth the hard work. College also opens the doors to so many extracurricular activities that a person may not have thought to participate in before.

For example to find another school with great student support and many things to become involve in. Also, to find a school that is much more affordable especially after paying so much for one year and having many problems with the internet , elevators, hot water vandalism and the food.

If there was a magic time machine, I would tell myself to relax and enjoy the experience. Study as many interesting courses as I can no matter what anyone thinks is a waste of time because if you enjoy it, then it isn't a waste of time.  I would also stress the improtance of friendship. Without friends, college will be tougher than you can ever imagine.. Transitioning to living with roomates can be a chore, but these will be some of the best friends anyone can make in a lifetime.

Ask questions about the meals and food on campus, the student's favorite and least favorite things about the school, and ask for their info to contact them on facebook or email them, in case you have more questions.  Also eat at the dining hall on a day when not a lot of tours are going on- to make sure you like the \"everyday\" food.  Also, ask how easy it is for students to get in touch with their advisors (this is a big deal when it comes to registering for classes or switching them).

Find out what careers your teenager is interested in, and try to match their dreams to a major. Let them know that rewarding careers are about much more than a means of money, and studying something they enjoy will generally open doors for jobs, promotions and benefits they might not even know exist which would fit their dreams.\nTo students: I would suggest starting off by looking at an indepth description of every major invented. There just might be a field of study you had no idea existed, and the field of study you thought about going into might be completely different than you imagined. Do not be afraid of applying for significant loans if you have faith you are studying in college with a purpose.

                "Robert": "The fact that it is wide open to a terrible neighborhood and not gated off, and not very well-guarded.",

There is a lot of violence and crime both on and off campus. Although academically AIC is a good school, the crime is a large deterrant.",

People getting close to/ or a free ride financially do not  appreciate the fact AIC is a school with faculty there ready to help give them a chance to really maximize their potential. The motivation for post college sucess is low due to the lack of information circulating about job availability and possible careers, and many people choose to go do the minimum because they can get away with it."

AIC has a lot to offer and will not let anyone who is uptight or parochial in their social, political, and economical opinions stand in their way.  In addition, if you are not accustomed to the city life then I wouldn't reccomend attending AIC.",

Being there less than a year I feel so confident about my future--the instructors are so amazingly confident in each individual--they push you towards the right direction with extremeconfidence and determination. I also brag about how large the school actually is--I've been to a few other colleges but nothing this big--it's amazing only because I'm a small town girl and have only seen small things in my town.",

I feel like the most frustrating thing about American International College is not having enough campus activities.  Campus activites create a bond with everyone and shows unity.  There are events once in a while, but I think we should have more such as a guest speaker or community service.",
