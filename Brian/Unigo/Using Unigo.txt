How to use Unigo class.
Currently, the class is configured such that the scraper will attempt to scrape ALL of the schools that are in Unigo's database.
There is a csv called "AllCampus.csv", which contains all U.S. campuses (could be worldwide, not sure). 
Unfortunately, Unigo doesn't use an "ID" system like RMP. Instead, their website for schools goes something like this:
    https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-southern-california
Hence, the python script gets each name of the campus from the csv and replaces the spaces with dashes "-". And then it scrapes the website. 

If you want to scrape a specific school, find its ID NUMBER using the Unigo website, and then run this command:
    SCHOOL = RMPScraperByID(ID_NUM, scrapeOneSchool=True)
    SCHOOL.makeJson()

The output is a json file with the name SCHOOL.json. Here is an example json file (truncated)

{
    "University of California-Los Angeles" : {
        "About" : "Founded in 1919, University of California-Los Angeles.",
        "School Overall Score" : 4.5,
        "School On-campus housing" : 3.4,
        "School Off-campus housing" : 3.0,
        "School Campus food" : 3.6,
        "School Campus facilities" : 4.4,
        "Individual Opinions" : {
            "Anna" : {
                "Rating" : 4
                "Comment" : "UCLA is a great place"
            }
        }
        "FAQ" : {
            "Describe a typical weekend" : {
                "Bernadette" : "It's pretty chill ngl"
                "Bob" : "Hot California"
            }
        }
    }
}


You can import this json as a dictionary in Python. All the data can be accessed!
